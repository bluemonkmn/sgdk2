      <h1>Map Manager</h1>
      <p>Use this window to edit the general parameters of a map within the project. 
         This window is displayed when creating a new map, or by editing the properties 
         of a map node in the project tree (by double-clicking it or selecting it and 
         choosing the "Properties" command from the View menu).</p>
      <h2>Name</h2>
      <p>The name of a map must be unique among all map names in the project. A name 
         must begin with a letter and contain only letters, digits and spaces.</p>
      <p>Each map is associated with its own source code file in the generated project. 
         The name of the map determines the filename of the source code file containing 
         all code for the map (which is the name of the map with "_Map.cs" appended).</p>
      <h2>Scrollable Size</h2>
      <p>Simply stated, this is the size of the map. The size is specified independently 
         of the layer sizes because you may have layers that you don't want to be 
         entirely visible within the map (for example if a portion of a layer is used 
         only as a source of tiles for copying to another part of the layer). To 
         understand this size, consider a map with a scrollable size of 800x600 
         displayed on a screen that shows 640x480 pixels. Such a map will be able to 
         scroll 160 pixels to the right (800 minus 640) and 120 pixels down (600 minus 
         480). Notice how the display size plus the distance that a map can scroll 
         represents the total scrollable size for the map.</p>
      <p>To easily calculate a reasonable value for the Scrollable Size based on the 
         layers within the map, use the "Wizard..." button. It will allow you calculate 
         a size based on a desire to make all areas of all layers visible or a desire to 
         keep the map from scrolling to any area where any one of the layers will not 
         fill the display. (You can also select a subset of layers on which to base this 
         calculation.)</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that changing a layer's scroll rate or size, or changing the 
         resolution of the game after setting this may result in layers no longer 
         exhibiting the desired behavior specified in the wizard, until you update the 
         Scrollable Size in accordance with new conditions.</p>
      <h2>Scroll Margin</h2>
      <p>Each side of the display has a scroll margin associated with it on each map. 
         This number is used when using rules that scroll the map. Scrolling a sprite 
         into view can use the scroll margins of the map containing the sprite to 
         position the view so that the sprite will maintain a minimum distance between 
         the edge of the display and itself. A bottom scroll margin of 100, for example, 
         will ensure that the sprite doesn't come within less than 100 pixels of the 
         bottom of the display unless it has reached the bottom of the map.</p>
      <h2>View</h2>
      <p>If you don't want the map to completely fill the display when it is active, you 
         can specify a smaller area in which to draw the map. If you want to map to fill 
         the display regardless of the resolution, you can specify all zeros, and the 
         size will default to fill the display.</p>
