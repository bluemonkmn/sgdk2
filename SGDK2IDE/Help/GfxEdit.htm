      <h1>Graphics Editor</h1>
      <p>The integrated graphics editor has many features. For details about a 
         particulat feature, you can click on the screenshot over a tool or area about 
         which you want more information, or you can scroll down to see features listed 
         in the order they appear in the menus. Not all features from the menus are 
         visible in the screenshot.</p>

      <h2>File Menu</h2>
      <h3>Import Graphic</h3>
      <P>Select any portion of an external image file to import into the cell editor. 
         The size if the imported graphic must be a multiple of the width and height of 
         the cell size, and must fit in the current size of teh graphics editor at the 
         current magnification.</P>
      <h3>Export Graphic</h3>
      <P>Export the contents of the image currently loaded into the cell editor to an 
         external file. Supported file formats&nbsp;are PNG, BMP, GIF, JPG and 
         TIF.&nbsp; The PNG format is recommended for retaining alpha transparency.</P>
      <h3>Export Sheet as Image</h3>
      <P>Exports the entire graphic sheet (as currently persisted in the Cell Manager 
         window) as an external image file. Only PNG format is supported.&nbsp; The PNG 
         retains alpha transparency.</P>
      <h3>Import Image as Sheet</h3>
      <P>Imports an external image as the entire contents of the graphic sheet, 
         replacing all graphics currently in the sheet. Only PNG format is 
         supported.&nbsp; The imported graphic must be exactly the size of the graphic 
         sheet: c*w pixels wide and r*h pixels tall, where&nbsp;c is the number of cell 
         columns, w is the width of each cell in pixels,&nbsp;r is the number of cell 
         rows and h is the height of each cell in pixels.&nbsp; This feature is 
         particularly useful if you've exported an entire graphic sheet for editing in 
         an external program and would like to re-import the updated version.</P>
      <P>
         <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> you can also import a graphic sheet from another project 
         by right-clicking on the "Graphic Sheets" folder in the project tree and 
         selecting "Import From..."</P>
      <h2>View Menu</h2>
      <h3><a id="Zoom">Zoom</a></h3>
      <P>You can use the "+" and "-" keys, the toolbar dropdown selector or the Zoom 
         menu to increase and decrease the magnification level of the magnified view 
         where editing takes place.&nbsp;Higher levels of magnification allow higher 
         precision not only in the sense that you can see more detail, but in the sense 
         that the mouse can be positioned at finer divisions within a pixel, which may 
         be especially useful when anti-aliasing is turned on.&nbsp;For example, when 
         the magnification is at 4x4, the mouse can be positioned at 16 positions within 
         each pixel, but at 8x8 magnification, the mouse can distinguish 64 different 
         positions within each pixel, each which will yield different results when 
         anti-aliased.&nbsp; Keep in mind that, since this is designed as a tile 
         editor,&nbsp;editing large graphics at high magnifications may not be 
         practical.</P>
      <h2>Edit Menu</h2>
      <h3>Undo</h3>
      <P>You can undo your most recent actions in the editor.&nbsp; This cannot be used 
         to undo operations such as loading and storing graphics, but can be used to 
         undo most or all operations confined to the cell editor.&nbsp; The undo buffer 
         stores 10 images representing the 10 most recent states of the editor.</P>
      <h3>Redo</h3>
      <P>If you undo an operation that you wanted to keep, redo will&nbsp;cycle the 
         opposite direction through the 10-level undo buffer.</P>
      <h3>Cut</h3>
      <P>After using the irregular selection, rectangular selection, select all, or 
         color wand commands, you can cut the selection to remove it from the image 
         (erase it) and optionally paste it elsewhere.&nbsp; The clipped image is stored 
         in teh system clipboard so it can be pasted into other applications.&nbsp; 
         However, support for alpha transparency&nbsp;is limited.&nbsp; If you use the 
         Cut command without any active selection, the entire image will be copied, but 
         nothing will be deleted.</P>
      <h3>Copy</h3>
      <P>After using the selection tools mentioned in "Cut" above, you can copy the 
         selected portion of the image to the system&nbsp;clipboard without erasing it 
         from the image.&nbsp; If you use the Copy command without any active selection, 
         the entire image will be copied.</P>
      <h3>Paste</h3>
      <P>You can paste images that have been cut/copied from other tiles or other 
         graphic sheets or even external applications.&nbsp; However, external 
         applications will likely not provide alpha transparency support.&nbsp; For 
         transferring images with transparency to the graphics editor, the "import 
         graphic" command is best.&nbsp; After you paste an image, it is represented as 
         a "floating" selection, which means that you may drag it to another position or 
         transform it with rotation and scaling without affecting the image underneath.</P>
      <h3>Delete Selection</h3>
      <P>If there is a "floating" selection, remove it without merging it into the 
         current image, otherwise replace the selected area with transparent pixels and 
         de-select it.</P>
      <h3>Reset Position</h3>
      <P>After moving, rotating or sizing the selection, you can use this command to 
         reset the selection to its initial position.</P>
      <h3>Select All</h3>
      <P>Select the entire area in the cell editor for operations such as cut, copy, 
         rotate, scale and move.</P>
      <h3>Deselect All</h3>
      <P>If any pending selection is still "floating" in a state where you can move it 
         (for example after a paste or move operation), it will be "dropped" onto the 
         image (merged).&nbsp; The selection will then be&nbsp;un-highlighted, so there 
         is no selection.</P>
      <h3><a id="FlipHorizontally">Flip Horizontally</a></h3>
      <P>Flip the current selection horizontally accross the center of the 
         selection.&nbsp; If there is no selection, the entire tile is flipped.</P>
      <h3><a id="FlipVertically">Flip Vertically</a></h3>
      <P>Flip the current selection vertically accross the center of the 
         selection.&nbsp; If there is no selection, the entire tile is flipped.</P>
      <h3><a id="HorizontalOffsetAndWrap">Horizontal Offset and Wrap</a></h3>
      <P>This effectively puts the right half of the tile on the left side of the editor 
         and the left half of the tile on the right.&nbsp; This is only supported when 
         the width of the tile is an even number of pixels (in order to ensure that 
         clicking the button twice will leave you where you started).&nbsp; The command 
         will work when the width is odd, but the rightmost column of pixels will be 
         untouched.&nbsp;This command is useful for adjusting the seams at the edge of 
         the tile to make sure it merges smoothly when tiled with itself.&nbsp;If there 
         is a floating selection when you execute this command, it will not move.</P>
      <h3><a id="VerticalOffsetAndWrap">Vertical Offset and Wrap</a></h3>
      <P>This effectively puts the&nbsp;bottom half of the tile on top of the editor and 
         the top half of the tile on the bottom.&nbsp; This is only supported when 
         the&nbsp;height of the tile is an even number of pixels (in order to ensure 
         that clicking the button twice will leave you where you started).&nbsp; The 
         command will work when the&nbsp;height is odd, but the&nbsp;bottom row&nbsp;of 
         pixels will be untouched.&nbsp;This command is useful for adjusting the seams 
         at the edge of the tile to make sure it merges smoothly when tiled with itself. 
         If there is a floating selection when you execute this command, it will not 
         move.</P>
      <h3><a id="PreviewTiling">Preview Tiling</a></h3>
      <P>Shows a window full of this&nbsp;image&nbsp;tiled&nbsp;over the whole 
         window.&nbsp; This is useful to ensure that this image tiles cleanly.</P>
      <h3><a id="RemapHues">Remap Hues</a></h3>
      <P>Allows you to replace one range of colors with another based on hue.&nbsp; 
         Click and drag an arc around the edge of the left-hand color wheel to define a 
         range of hues that will be affected.&nbsp; Then click and drag an arc around 
         the edge of the right-hand color wheel to define a range of hues that will 
         replace the range selected in the left wheel.&nbsp; For example, if you click 
         on yellow and drag clockwise&nbsp;through magenta in the left color wheel, and 
         then click on green and drag counter-clockwise through blue in the right color 
         wheel, then yellow hues will be replaced with green, orange hues with sea 
         green, red hues with cyan, and magenta hues with blue.&nbsp; All the hues in 
         between will also be smoothly mapped to corresponding hues in the target 
         range.&nbsp; This is useful for recoloring objects, but is not effective on 
         gray, and can't be used to enhance or diminish brightness or saturation levels.</P>
      <P>As you drag the color ranges you can see a preview of the result in the editor, 
         however, if you move a window in front of the image and cause it to re-display, 
         the original image will be drawn rather than the preview.&nbsp; The proposed 
         (preview) image is only drawn when an arc is being dragged.</P>
      <P>If&nbsp;a selection is active when using this tool, only the selection will be 
         affected, otherwise the entire graphic will be affected.</P>
      <h3><a id="AddNoise">Add Noise</a></h3>
      <P>Add random noise to the image.&nbsp; This is useful for large smooth areas that 
         should show some texture.&nbsp; You will be prompted for a noise level, 
         which&nbsp;determines how much the image will be affected.&nbsp; If a selection 
         is active with using this tool, only the selected area will be affected, 
         otherwise the entire image will be affected.&nbsp; Note the alpha level of each 
         pixel remains the same.&nbsp; No noise will appear in transparent areas.</P>
      <h3>Selection Highlight</h3>
      <P>By default, any selection made in the editor is represented by highlighting it 
         in blue.&nbsp; If the default selection color of blue is too distracting for 
         your current task, you&nbsp;can change the color, select a fainter variation, 
         or turn off the&nbsp;selection highlighting completely.&nbsp; Ctrl-T is a handy 
         shortcut to remember when you quickly want to see what the image looks like 
         without the highlight and then turn it back on.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this 
         highlight color also affects the Cell Manager, so if you turn off the highlight 
         and wonder why you can't see any selected cell in the Cell Manager, remember to 
         turn it back on.</P>
      <h3>Backdrop</h3>
      <P>The backdrop appears behind your image and represents areas that are 
         transparent in your image.&nbsp; It exists to clarify which portions of your 
         image are transparent versus a particular (opaque) color.&nbsp; If it's hard to 
         determine which pixels are transparent with the default backdrop, you can 
         change to a variety of other backdrops.&nbsp; Generally you want to use light 
         backdrops with dark images and darg backdrops with light images in order to 
         contrast the transparent pixels from the opaque pixels.</P>
      <h3><a id="Grid">Grid</a></h3>
      <P>Turns on a grid of white lines delineating the edges of the pixels.&nbsp; This 
         is only applicable for magnifications of 4x4 or higher.</P>
      <h2>Tools Menu</h2>
      <h3><a id="FreeDraw">Freehand Drawing</a></h3>
      <P>Works like&nbsp;a paint brush or a pencil.&nbsp; Just drag strokes out in the 
         editor.&nbsp; Note that you can use this with the "Filled Shapes" and "Gradient 
         Fills" options to draw an irregular filled shape freehand.</P>
      <h3><a id="FreehandLines">Freehand Lines</a></h3>
      <P>Draw straight lines or edges.&nbsp;Click one then move the mouse to another 
         location to draw a straight line between the two points.&nbsp;Move again and 
         click again to draw a series of connected lines.&nbsp;Right-click to finish. 
         Use this with the "Filled Shapes" and "Gradient Fills" options if you want to 
         draw shapes with straight edges that are filled with a solid or gradient 
         fill.&nbsp; Dragging the mouse while using this tool will cause it to behave 
         like the Freehand Drawing tool, but allow you to then proceed to add straight 
         lines afterward.&nbsp; If the "Lock Tools Proportions" option is selected (use 
         the&nbsp;Shift key to activate and de-activate on the fly) the angles of the 
         lines will be confined to a limited set.</P>
      <h3><a id="BezierCurves">Bezier Curves</a></h3>
      <P>Click once to define the starting point.&nbsp; Click again to define and end 
         point.&nbsp; Click a third time to affect the end of the line near the starting 
         point, and click a fourth to affect the end of the line near the end 
         point.&nbsp; Affecting the line generates a smooth curve leading from the 
         starting point ot the end point.&nbsp; Continue this process by clicking a 
         fifth time to add a new end point, a sixth to affect the beginning of the new 
         segment, and a seventh to affect the end of the new segment.&nbsp; Repeat as 
         much as you like to form a series of connected curves.&nbsp; This can be used 
         with "Filled Shapes" and "Gradient Fills".&nbsp; Right click at any time to 
         make the image you're looking at permanent.</P>
      <h3><a id="Line">Line</a></h3>
      <P>Click and drag a single straight line.&nbsp; Use the Shift key or "Lock Tools 
         Proportions" if you want to confine the angle of the line</P>
      <h3><a id="Rectangle">Rectangle</a></h3>
      <P>Click and drag a rectangle into the image by specifying the opposite 
         corners.&nbsp; Use the Shift key or "Lock Tools Proportions" if you want to 
         draw a square.</P>
      <h3><a id="Ellipse">Ellipse</a></h3>
      <P>Click and drag a rectangle the defines the boundaries of an ellipse to add to 
         the image.&nbsp; Use the Shift key or "Lock Tools Proportions" if you want to 
         draw a circle.</P>
      <h3><a id="Airbrush">Airbrush</a></h3>
      <P>Draw dithered pixels on the image.&nbsp;This is most effective when the 
         Anti-Alias option is on.&nbsp;The airbrush will draw only opaque pixels when 
         anti-aliasing is off, but will draw many partially opaque pixels when 
         performing anti-aliasing.&nbsp;The airbrush uses the current solid/fill color 
         to draw pixels onto the image in random patterns.&nbsp;The radius of pixels 
         affected (around the cursor) is determined by the current pen size.</P>
      <h3><a id="Smooth">Smooth</a></h3>
      <P>Blend hard edges between two colors into a smooth gradient.&nbsp;This is useful 
         for eliminating seams.&nbsp;The radius affected by this tool is determined by 
         the pen size.&nbsp;This tool may have unexpected effects when used around 
         transparent pixels.&nbsp; It tends to affect transparent pixels dramatically 
         because transparent pixels, unlike other pixels, have no opposing effect on the 
         colors around them.&nbsp; It's not possible to "blend" transparency into an 
         opaque color, only to "blend" an opaque color into transparency... kind of like 
         trying to blend paper with ink.</P>
      <h3><a id="Erase">Erase</a></h3>
      <P>Draw 100% transparent pixels onto the image, replacing existing 
         pixels.&nbsp;Selecting this tool automatically selects a large pen 
         size.&nbsp;Remember to switch back to the desired size before using another 
         tool.&nbsp; The effect of this tool is the same as selecting the "Copy" 
         coloring mode, the "Freehand Drawing" tool, the "Large" pen size, and a color 
         with alpha level 0, but easier to accomplish, and doesn't actually change the 
         coloring mode or current color.</P>
      <h3><a id="GradientFill">Gradient Fill</a></h3>
      <P>Draw color cradients onto the image.&nbsp; Click and drag a range onto the 
         image to draw the gradient.&nbsp; The gradient is formed by generating a smooth 
         series of colors between the starting point and the ending point of the drag 
         with the Solid color at the starting point and the Line color at the ending 
         point.&nbsp; This range is then extended perpendicular to that line, and 
         reversed and repeated parallel to the line&nbsp;to fill the image.&nbsp; For 
         example, dragging from the top of the image to middle of the image will draw a 
         gradient from the solid color at the top to the line color in the middle and 
         mirror that on the bottom half of the image.&nbsp; The gradient will&nbsp;fill 
         the horizontal space with stripes of the same color filling each row.&nbsp; If 
         there is an active selection the gradient fill will only affect the selected 
         area.</P>
      <h3><a id="FloodFill">Flood Fill</a></h3>
      <P>Flood fill areas of similar colors with the currently selected solid 
         color.&nbsp; Click on a pixel and drag to nearby pixels to specify a range of 
         colors that you want to be affected by the fill.&nbsp; If you click on a single 
         pixel, only pixels with exactly that color will be flooded with the new 
         color.&nbsp; If you drag to different color, both colors will be affects, as 
         will any colors that are "between" those two colors. "Between" means that the 
         largest difference in the R, G, B and A components of the color from the source 
         color is less than or equal to that difference between the end color and the 
         start color.&nbsp; If the "Affect Unjoined Color Regions" option is selected, 
         this tool will affect all pixels of these colors in the image instead of only 
         affecting adjacent (connected) pixels.</P>
      <h3><a id="ColorWand">Color Wand</a></h3>
      <P>This is similar to the flood fill, but instead of changing the pixels' colors, 
         they are selected as the active selection.</P>
      <h3><a id="RectangularSelection">Rectangular Selection</a></h3>
      <P>Click and drag a rectangular area to select it.</P>
      <h3><a id="IrregularSelection">Irregular Selection</a></h3>
      <P>Draw an outline around an arbitrarily-shaped area to select it.</P>
      <h3><a id="MoveSelection">Move Selection</a></h3>
      <P>As soon as you start dragging with this tool, the selection is effectively cut 
         from the image and "floated" above it so you can move it to any location you 
         want.&nbsp; The image is moved in the direction and distance determined by the 
         drag.&nbsp; If there is no selection the entire image is "floated" and 
         moved.&nbsp;</P>
      <h3><a id="RotateSelection">Rotate Selection</a></h3>
      <P>Drag the mouse rightward or downward to rotate the selection clockwise.&nbsp; 
         Drag the mouse leftward or upward to rotate counter-clockwise.&nbsp; 
         Anti-aliasing is recommended for smooth results.&nbsp; If there is no 
         selection, the entire image is "floated" and rotated.</P>
      <h3><a id="SizeSelection">Size Selection</a></h3>
      <P>Drag rightward to widen (stretch) the selecttion.&nbsp; Drag downward to 
         increase the height of the selection.&nbsp; Drag leftward or upward to compress 
         the selection. If you drag left or up far enough, the image will be inverted 
         and the actions above will then have the opposite effect.&nbsp; If there is no 
         selection, the entire image is "floated" and affected.</P>
      <h3><a id="ColorPickDropper">Color Pick Dropper</a></h3>
      <P>Clicking with this tool will select that color under the cursor as the active 
         color. This is useful if you want to exactly match a particular color to add 
         something new to the image using that color (especially if it's no longer in 
         the recent colors list).&nbsp;Most tools will allow you to right-click to 
         temporarily switch to the color dropper and do a "quick pick" of the pixel 
         color currently&nbsp;behind the cursor, without having to explicitly switch 
         tools.</P>
