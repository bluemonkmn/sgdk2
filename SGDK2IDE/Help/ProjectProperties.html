      <h1>Project Properties</h1>
      <p>This window defines properties that apply to the overall project. These can be edited 
         by double-clicking the top root node in the project tree or selecting it and 
         choosing "Properties" from the view menu.</p>
      <h2>Credits</h2>
      <p>These credits are embedded in the generated game and can be viewed in the 
         generated game by selecting "About..." from the help menu when the game is in 
         windowed mode. Credits are automatically updated when importing objects. The 
         credits of an imported object will be merged with the project's credits as it 
         is imported. Note, however, that they are not removed if the object is later 
         deleted. Therefore it is recommended that you remember to verify the 
         correctness of the credits before releasing a game. To directly edit the 
         credits, click on this line, and then click the "..." button to display a text 
         editor with the credits.</p>
      <h2>DisplayMode</h2>
      <p>This determines size of the window or display resolution for the game. All map 
         views (defined by the view property in the <a href="MapManager.html">Map Manager</a>) 
         must fit within this size. The game display cannot be resized at runtime.</p>
      <h2>MaxPlayers</h2>
      <p>This determines the number of players displayed in the options dialog of the 
         generated game. If the number is 1, then there is no dropdown list to select 
         which player's settings to edit. The remainder of the responsibility for 
         handling the actual number of current players and mapping their input to the 
         sprites falls to the rules defined in the project.</p>
      <h2>MaxViews</h2>
      <p>This determines how many views can be displayed by the maps in this project. If 
         there are multiple views, each map will track distinct scroll positions
         for the different views that are currently active.</p>
      <h2>OverlayMap</h2>
      <p>If you have a map that you want to draw in front of the map where gameplay is 
         happening (for instance, a map to represent the player's current inventory and 
         status that is visible at most or all times), select it here. The overlay map 
         can be changed at runtime, but this will set the initial value. To remove the 
         overlay map, select the first (empty) item from the dropdown list.</p>
      <h2>StartMap</h2>
      <p>Indicates the map that will initially be active as the main map when the game 
         begins running. (This could be a regular map where the game runs, or it could 
         be a menu map that has options to transfer control to various other maps.)</p>
      <h2>TitleText</h2>
      <p>The text entered here appears on the title bar of the running game. It is also used
      to store the text that appears when importing from a template file. To provide
      additional information that will appear when the SGDK2 file is selected as an
      import source (displayed by various import wizards), enter it here.</p>
      <h2>Windowed</h2>
      <p>Selecting True here will start the game in a window by default. Selecting False 
         will start the game in full screen mode by default. The mode can be switched at 
         runtime by pressing Alt+Enter.</p>
