   <h1>Edit Counters</h1>
<P>Counters are globally accessible named variables.  All counters can 
only contain integer values between 0 and 2,000,000,000.  They are useful 
for things such as tracking player inventory, completion of game events, the 
passage of time or linking with tile animation.  Note that sprite 
definitions can have their own parameters, so if you want to track values 
associated with a particular sprite, you should consider a sprite parameter 
instead.</P>
<P>A counter definition includes a maximum value to ensure that a counter can 
never exceed a specified bound.  This also allows the value to be passed to 
rules without having to provide a maximum value as a separate parameter.</P>
<H2>Name</H2>
<P>The counter name must be unique among all counter names in the project.  
Names must begin with a letter and contain only letters, digits and spaces.</P>
<H2>Maximum</H2>
<P>This can be a value from 1 to 2,000,000,000.  The counter will not be 
able to exceed the specified maximum.  The maximum can be used with certain 
rules such as those that draw inventory items, for example, where the ratio of 
the current value to the maximum determines how much of an inventory bar is 
filled.</P>
<H2>Value</H2>
<P>The initial value of the counter when the game begins is determined by this 
setting.  The value must be between 0 and the specified maximum 
(inclusive).</P>
