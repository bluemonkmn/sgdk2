      <h1>Edit Plans</h1>
      <p>Plans can be used to perform very specific tasks within the context of a 
         particular layer in a particular map. When provided with coordinates in the <a href="MapEditor.html">
            map editor</a>, a plan can even implement rules for a specific location on a 
         layer. That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that a plan can't be used for 
         global purposes. Since a project can have an "overlay" map defined (a map which 
         is always active in the foreground regardless of which map is the primary focus 
         at the moment) plans can be added to this map, and will always be applied as 
         long as the overlay map is active. One kind of plan that might fit well in that 
         context is a plan that increments a global animation counter (that is linked to 
         all animated tiles).</p>
      <p>Two different aspects of plans are edited in two contexts:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            The rules defining the actions a plan takes, and under which conditions, are 
            defined in the edit plans window described here.</li>
         <li>
            The data contained by the plan, namely the coordinates that make up a plan's 
            path or rectangle, and the properties associated with the plan and its 
            coordinates are maintained in the <a href="MapEditor.html">map editor</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To open the edit plans window, you can:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Right-click on the "Plans" folder within any layer in the project tree and 
            select new to create a new plan.</li>
         <li>
            Select the "Plans" folder and choose "New Object" from the File menu or toolbar 
            to create a new plan.</li>
         <li>
            Double-click an existing plan in the "Plans" folder to edit an existing plan.</li>
         <li>
            Select an existing plan in the "Plans" folder and choose "Properties" from the 
            View menu or "Edit" from the context (right-mouse) menu.</li>
         <li>
            Select an existing plan in the map editor and choose "Selected Plan Details" 
            from the map editor's "Edit" menu or toolbar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are two levels to understanding the process of editing plans. This page 
         will describe the user interface itself - generally how plans are edited in 
         this window. However, the more interesting detailed aspects of editing plans 
         are in the individual rule functions that a plan can use. For more information
         about details of the individual rule functions that a plan can use, see:</p>
      <h3><a href="ms-its:SGDK2 Coding Reference.chm::/default.html">Coding Reference</a></h3>
      <p>The root page of the coding reference summarizes the process of using the individual
         rule functions. The remainder of the reference contains detailed descriptions of
         individual functions.</p>
      <h2>Defining Plans</h2>
      <h3>Name</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">A plan name must be unique among all plans on the same layer. 
         Names must begin with a letter and contain only letters, digits and spaces.</p>
      <h3>Priority</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">In most cases, a plan should not care when it is executed in 
         relation to other plans, so this setting can be ignored. However, if such a 
         case does arise, this value can be set to control the sequence in which plans 
         are processed. Plans with higher numbers will execute after plans with lower 
         numbers.</p>
      <h3>Rules Toolbar</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">A toolbar appears above the hierarchical list of rules to 
         manage the creating, deleting and moving of rules in the list. The same 
         commands appear in the "Plan" menu.</p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li class="SubPara">
            Add New Rule: Create a new rule with a default name including a uniquely 
            identifying number. The rule is inserted after the currently highlighted rule 
            in the list, or at the end if no rule is highlighted.</li>
         <li class="SubPara">
            Delete Rule: Delete the selected rule. <strong>Note</strong> that only one rule 
            can be deleted at a time, and subordinate rules are not deleted when a parent 
            rule is deleted. If a rule represents a condition, and contains a number of 
            rules inside it, and you delete the condition, then all the rules inside it 
            move up a level and are executed without checking the condition (because the 
            condition has been deleted and is gone). The rule marking the end of the 
            condition, however, will not be deleted and should be updated appropriately if 
            it is no longer to mark the end of a block.</li>
         <li class="SubPara">
            Move Rule Up: Swaps the selected rule with the rule above it. <strong>Note</strong>
            that this does not skip over nested rules, or move nested rules as a group. If 
            you move the beginning of a condition, the rule preceding the condition will be 
            moved into the condition block rather than after the end of the entire 
            condition block. Likewise, if you move a rule after the end of the condition 
            up, it will move into the condition instead of jumping over the entire block.</li>
         <li class="SubPara">
            Move Rule Down: Swaps the selected rule with the rule below it. <strong>Note</strong>
            that this does not skip over nested rules, or move nested rules as a group. If 
            you move the beginning of a condition, the first rule nested within the 
            condition will be moved outside the condition block rather than moving the 
            entire condition block down. Likewise, if you move the rule representing the 
            end of the condition down, it will move the following rule into the condition.</li>
         <li class="SubPara">
            Copy Rules: Various copy commands will copy all the details of the specified rule
            or rules so that the rule can be easily transferred, for example, to another plan.
            The rule can also be pasted to a sprite definition, but since plan rules are not
            always compatible with sprite rules, some tweaking may be necessary when doing so.
            The sub-items in this menu allow you to copy the currently highlighted rule
            including all the rules contained within it (in the tree node), or excluding them,
            or copy all the rules displayed in the tree.</li>
         <li class="SubPara">
            Paste Rules: Once rules have been copied from a plan or a sprite definition, they
            can be pasted into a plan using this command. Note that when pasting
            sprite definition rules into a plan, some tweaking may be necessary to make the
            rules conform to the features supported by plans. Not all functions
            available in a sprite definition are available for plans. The sub-items in this
            menu allow you to paste the copied rules either before or after the selected rule.
            If no rule is selected, they will be pasted at the end of the list.</li>
         <li class="SubPara">
            Toggle Suspend for This and Child Rules: This will toggle the state of the
            &quot;Suspend this rule&quot; checkbox for the current rule, and set all the
            child rules' state to be the same. Normally, toggling the checkbox affects
            only the current rule, but it often doesn't make sense to turn off a parent
            rule without also turning off all the children, so this toggle can come in
            handy for disabling (or re-enabling) entire branches of rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Rule List</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This displays a list of rules associated with the current plan 
         in a hierarchical view. When a rule represents a condition or a loop that 
         affects a number of nested rules, the nested rules are indented under that rule 
         and can be collapsed into it. <strong>Note</strong> that a condition (a rule of 
         type "If") can also include an "Else" rule, which defines a series of rules to 
         apply when the "If" condition was false. Since the else also depends on the 
         same condition described in the "If" rule, it (and the statements applying to 
         it) is included as a nested rule along with the rest of the rules nested in the 
         condition. That may be difficult for programmers used to writing indented code 
         to get used to because often times code is written with the "Else" being 
         un-indented to the same level as the "If". But when displaying the rules in a 
         hierarchy it truly is part of the same condition, and therefore is nested 
         within the condition. (The code generated by the rules when the project is 
         compiled *is* indented as a programmer would expect, however.)</p>
      <h3>Rule Name</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The name of a rule is used to uniquely identify the rule within 
         the plan. Therefore the name must be unique among all rules within the same 
         plan. A rule name is not constrained by the same limitations as most names 
         because it does ot represent the name of an object that gets converted into 
         source code. The name of a rule simply becomes a comment in the generated code 
         when the project is compiled. The name of a rule can contain any characters 
         that can be typed into a single line. Some good guildelines or considerations 
         for naming rules will help to quickly understand rules when looking at them in 
         the rule list:</p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li>
            Use the word "Else" at the beginning of rules of type "Else" so it's easy to 
            tell when statements in a conditional rule apply to the false case of the 
            condition.</li>
         <li>
            Use the word "And" at the beginning of rules of type "And" so its easy to 
            distinguish components of the initial condition from rules that apply within 
            the condition.</li>
         <li>
            Use the word "Or" at the beginning of rules of type "Or" so its easy to 
            distinguish components of the initial condition from rules that apply within 
            the condition.</li>
         <li>
            Prepend a "* " to the names of rules that have been suspended so its easy to 
            find rules that are not active but could easily be turned on.</li>
         <li>
            Include details about the context of a rule in its name so that it won't 
            collide with the names of other rules performing similar things in a different 
            context. For example, instead of naming a rule "Teleport", name it "Teleport 
            player 1" if you will be handling teleportation of multiple players within the 
            same rule.</li>
         <li>
            Keep in mind, the more details that are included in the rule names, the more 
            information will be available when reading the rule list. But also keep in mind 
            that there is no word wrapping in the rule list, so space is limited.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="SubPara">Of course you are free to devise your own guidelines as well, 
         but these guidelines are used in the included samples and following them will 
         make your rules consistent with any imported samples.</p>
      <h3>Suspend this rule</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This will exclude the rule from being included in the generated 
         project. It will be treated as if it does not exist when compiling and running 
         the project. One reason to do this is to easily turn on and turn off debugging 
         rules. There may be a rule to give the player some object or teleport the 
         player to a certain location to make testing easier. Of course such a rule 
         should be turned off (suspended) when compiling the final project. Another 
         reason to do this may be when creating rules to serve as a template that might 
         be used in other projects. If there is a rule that specifically applies to 
         supporting the use of ladders, but the project doesn't use ladders, the rule 
         can be suspended and then only turned on when using the template to create a 
         project that implements ladders.</p>
      <p class="SubPara"><strong>Note:</strong> It is strongly recommended when 
         suspending a rule that contains nested rules, all the nested rules also be 
         suspended. Unexpected behavior may occur if a rule is suspended without 
         suspending all of the rules nested within it. See the &quot;Toggle Suspend
         for This and Child Rules&quot; command above.</p>
      <h3>Rule Type</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">There are 8 fundamental classes of rules that can be defined 
         using the first dropdown list. If the descriptions of these types seem 
         overwhelming or confusing, skip them for now and just try out some examples 
         (look at some existing sample rules in other projects). These should be 
         relatively self explanatory, but you can refer to these descriptions for 
         detailed information about how they behave and why they exist. Before 
         proceeding, let's establish some terminology. A "Rule Type" is one of these 8 
         types selected in the first dropdown list. And the term "Rule Function" 
         (described in more detail below) will be used to refer to a specific function 
         selected in the second dropdown list.</p>
      <table id="Table1" class="SubPara" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" summary="First column lists a rules type, second lists the description of the type">
         <tr>
            <td>Do</td>
            <td>This simplest of rule types indicates that some action will be performed 
               rather than defining a condition or loop. Note that rule functions that are 
               normally associated with "If" type rules can also be used with "Do", and any 
               action that they perform will be executed, but the result will be ignored 
               instead of used to define a condition.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>If</td>
            <td>This defines the beginning of a condition. Rules that come after an "If" rule 
               will be nested within it until one of the rules uses the "End If" checkbox to 
               end the condition. The set of rule functions available with an "If" type rule 
               is limited. Only functions that return a true or false value can be used with 
               "If". (In the source code, the function must return "bool".) When the rule 
               returns success/true, the conditions nested in the "If" conditions will also 
               apply, otherwise they are skipped. (There are exceptions, see "Else" below.)</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>And</td>
            <td>This rule type can only be used immediately after an "If", "ElseIf", "While", 
               "And" or "Or" type rule, to extend the condition. The rules contained inside 
               the condition will only be applied if all the rules combined with "And" return 
               success/true. The same list of rule functions will be available for this rule 
               type as are available for the "If" rule type.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Or</td>
            <td>This rule type can only be used immediately after an "If", "ElseIf", "While", 
               "And" or "Or" type rule, to extend the condition. The rules contained inside 
               the condition will be applied if any one of the rules combined with "Or" return 
               success/true. The same list of rule functions will be available for this rule 
               type as are available for the "If" rule type.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>ElseIf</td>
            <td>This rule type can only be used within a block of rules started by "If" or 
               another "ElseIf". It begins a new condition block nested yet another level 
               below that of the current rule. The condition is only checked when the initial 
               condition failed (returned false), and the statements nested under this rule 
               are only applied if the initial condition failed and the condition specified in 
               this rule succeeds (returns true). Because the statements are nested another 
               level, you must remember to include at least two End If rules, one to finish 
               the nested condition and one to finish the initial condition. If there are 
               rules between the end of the inner condition and the end of the outer 
               condition, they will be executed when the outer condition's expression is false 
               regardless of the result of the inner condition.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Else</td>
            <td>This rule type can only be used within a block of rules started by an "If". It 
               causes the rules within the block after this one to be applied only if the 
               condition specified with "If" failed. This is actually more like an "Else Do" 
               than a plain "Else" because it also includes the ability to perform a function 
               within the same rule.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>End</td>
            <td>Normally when you create a rule, in order to make it the last rule in a nested 
               block of statements (the last rule that depends on an "If" condition, for 
               example) you can check the "End If/End While" box. However, there is no way to 
               indicate that a statement should be the last statement of two nested conditions 
               (for example, the end of an "If" block as well as another "If" block containing 
               that). That's the purpose of the "End" rule type. It's the only rule type that 
               doesn't perfom any action in itself (there's no rule function associated with 
               it). It just ends a block of nested statements that was started by an "If", 
               "ElseIf" or "While".</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>While</td>
            <td>This begins a block of statements that will execute repeatedly ("loop") as 
               long as a rule function returns success/true. This can be used in conjunction 
               with "And" and "Or" rule types to form complex conditions that must be met to 
               continue the loop. The same list of rule functions will be available for this 
               rule type as are available for the "If" rule type. It cannot be used in 
               conjunction with ElseIf or Else rules. In other words, you <strong>can</strong> 
               nest a "While" inside and "If" or an "ElseIf" block, and you <strong>can</strong>
               nest an "Else" or "ElseIf" rule inside an "If" block contained within a 
               "While", but you <strong>cannot</strong> directly include an "Else" or "ElseIf" 
               rule within a "While" block. Be careful with this rule type because it could 
               easily result in endless loops that will make the game freeze if used 
               incorrectly. It can also make the game run slowly.</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Not</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This checkbox can be used with the "If", "ElseIf", "While", 
         "And" or "Or" rule type to invert the result of the rule. For example, you can 
         check the "Not" box on a rule that reads "If - IsInputPressed" and then the 
         rules contained in this block will only apply when the specified key is <strong>not</strong>
         pressed.</p>
      <h3>Rule Function</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The second dropdown list on this form represents the rule 
         function associated with the rule. Here you can select one of the many 
         functions available to define plan behavior, including functions defined

         details about defining your own rule functions, see the <a href="ms-its:SGDK2 Coding Reference.chm::/default.html">

      <p class="SubPara">When defining an "If", "While", "And", "Or", "ElseIf", or 
         "While" type rule, the list of functions displays only rules that return a true 
         or false value (sometimes thought of as success or failure). These rule 
         functions are referred to as "boolean" functions. When defining a "Do" type 
         rule, all rule functions are available for use, and if a boolean function is 
         used, the function will perform its usual work (if any) but the result will 
         simply be ignored. This might be useful because some functions actually do 
         something that affects the game and then return a value indicating some true or 
         false value.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">After selecting a function, some or all of the parameter fields 
         below will open up for input. Each function has its own set of parameters, and 
         depending on how many parameters it uses and what types of parameters they are, 
         the boxes below will become available and present different options in the 
         dropdown lists. The box immediately below the rule function box will also 
         display a brief description of what the function is and how to use it. 
         Furthermore, if the function can output a number, the "Output to" box will open 
         up and allow you to select a counter, plan parameter or sprite parameter in which
         to store the result.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">If there is an error compiling the project or processing the 
         function name (it's possible to type an arbitrary name into the function field 
         in case you want to call an undocumented function) then the description field 
         will contain a generic error message and all the parameters will be available 
         for input, but without names. This is to allow a function to be specified even 
         if the environment doesn't know that it's valid.</p>
      <h3>Function Description</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">After a function is selected, a brief description of the 
         function is displayed in the box below. Don't forget that this box can scroll 
         and there may be more information than is initially displayed. Usually a 
         description will also include information about the meaning of the parameters 
         and output value if any.</p>
      <h3>Function Parameters</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Many rule functions can accept parameters that specify details 
         about how they should operate or what they should affect. In most cases a 
         helpful list of suggested values is provided in the dropdown list for each 
         parameter based on the type of the parameter, but any value can be manually 
         typed because not all possible values can be predicted. For example if you want 
         to call a function to display a message, you obviously won't be able to select 
         the message from the dropdown list, you'll have to type it in. That brings up 
         another important topic. When providing text for a parameter (also known as a 
         "string") you must enclose the text in quotes. This (indirectly) allows you to 
         include special formatting characters in the text. These are inserted with 
         "escape codes". Here are the most important escape codes with which you should 
         be familiar when entering a string into a parameter value:</p>
      <table id="Table2" class="SubPara" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" summary="Four columns each with a header describing the content, illustrating how escape codes in strings are used">
         <tr>

         </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="SubPara">Many other parameter types are available when defining rules 
         for plans. Below is a list, but it is by no means comprehensive because the 
         list is customizable. It can be expanded by adding your own enumerations in the 
         game project's source code folder:</p>

               number in projects where there are multiple views, and is included in this

      <h3>Output to</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Some functions output integer values. For those that do, this 
         field is enabled to allow you to specify where to put the result. If you don't 
         need to put it any place permanent, but just want to use it in a subsequent 
         rule (if nothing else interferes) you can use a temporary variable that is 
         provided by default named SharedTemp1. If necessary, you can add more such 
         shared variables by adding them after "SharedTemp1" in PlanBase.cs in the 
         SourceCode folder. Variables declared with "static" are shared among all plans 
         while variables declared without "static" are specific to the current plan and 
         can be set with a particular initial value in the map editor. Any counter value 
         and many other values listed after "Integer" type parameters above are also 
         available.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">Whereas parameters are all required, the "Output to" box can be 
         left blank if you don't care about storing or using the result of a rule 
         function.</p>
      <h3>End If / End While</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">If you want to mark this rule as the last rule in a block that 
         was started with an "If", "ElseIf", or "While" type rule, check this box. Note 
         that if you need to end two (or more) blocks at once, you will need to also add 
         an "End" type rule after this. The "End" type rule will allow you to add 
         another rule that has no function or parameters, and just checks the "End If / 
         End While" box.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">Take care to match every "If", "ElseIf" and "While" with one 
         and only one matching rule that has the "End If / End While" box checked. The 
         code generator will automatically close the remainder of your blocks if you 
         have some unfinished blocks at the end of your plan, but other failures to 
         match the beginnings of blocks with an end could result in unwanted behavior. 
         One occasion when this can be particularly tricky is when deleting a rule that 
         begins or ends a block. Be careful to find the corresponding rule at the other 
         end of the block and delete or adjust it appropriately too.</p>
