      <h1>Layer Manager</h1>
      <p>This window manages the general properties of a layer that must be provided 
         before the layer can be edited in the <a href="MapEditor.html">map editor</a>. 
         It appears when creating a new layer or when editing an existing layer by 
         double-clicking a layer node in the project tree or selecting it and choosing 
         "Properties" from the View menu. Using the wizard (click the "Wizard..." 
         button) is strongly recommended as an alternative to directly editing the 
         properties displayed in this window. The wizard can be used for defining new 
         layers or editing the properties of existing layers, and will step through the 
         meaning of each property and assist in picking reasonable values.</p>
      <p>The properties in this window can be grouped by category or simply displayed 
         alphabetically by clicking on the toolbar at the top of the grid. This page 
         will describe the properties as grouped categorically.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>These properties affect the graphics displayed by the layer</p>
      <h3>BackgroundTile</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">When creating a new layer, you must specify a background tile. 
         This tile will fill the new layer. Keep in mind that this doesn't necessarily 
         form the background because placing any tile on the layer will remove the 
         existing tile at that position and replace it with a new tile. For a true 
         background, you should use a separate layer behind this layer. When editing an 
         existing layer, specifying a background tile will replace all tiles on the 
         layer with the value specified here. A value of "-1" for the background tile 
         will leave the layer's tiles as they are (only an option when updating an 
         existing layer). If you want to see what tiles are available, use the wizard by 
         clicking on the "Wizard..." button.</p>
      <h3>Tileset</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Each layer must be associated with exactly one Tileset. The 
         tileset maps tile values on the layer (which are simply numbers) to images 
         displayed at the tiles' respective locations. Many details of how tiles are 
         displayed on the layer are defined in the tileset. See the <a href="TileEdit.html">
            Tileset Editor</a> for details about the effects of various tileset 
         parameters. For a visual tileset selector, use the wizard by clicking on the 
         "Wizard..." button.</p>
      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>These properties define how the layer interacts with other elements of the 
         project.</p>
      <h3>BytesPerTile</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Each tile on the layer is represented as a number. But the 
         number is limited. If you don't have too many tiles in your tileset, you can 
         store each tile in a single byte (which is a number between 0 and 255, 
         inclusive). This results in a relatively small amount of memory required to 
         store the layer's tiles. However, if you have more than 256 tiles in the 
         tileset, you will need to use more than one byte per tile to store the number 
         associated with each tile. Using 2 bytes per tile doubles the amount of space 
         used to store the tiles of your layer, but allows you to put up to 32,768 
         different tiles on the layer. (A 2-byte integer can contain 65536 different 
         values, but half of them are reserved for negative numbers, and 32,768 seems 
         like a reasonably high enough number that the other half of the range is not 
         important.) It's hard to imagine a realistic use for using 4-bytes per tile, 
         but it is provided for completeness and allows you to distinguish over 2 
         billion types of tiles. Using the wizard will automatically suggest a 
         reasonable value for this based on the number of tiles in the tileset.</p>
      <h3>Priority</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The sprites contained within a layer can draw behind the tiles, 
         interleaved with the tiles, or in front of the tiles on the layer. The layer's 
         priority value (combined with the sprites' priority values) determines where 
         the layer's tiles draw in relation to the sprites. A priority of 0 will draw 
         before (behind) a priority of 1, so if you want your sprites to remain in front 
         of the layer's tiles when there is overlap, you can set the priority of the 
         layer to be less than that of the sprites. If the priority of the layer is 
         equal to the priority of a sprite, the sprite will be drawn in front of tiles 
         above it and behind tiles below it. More specifically, the sprite will draw 
         behind a tile if the tile's origin is below that of the sprite, otherwise it 
         will draw in front of it. The position of the origin in relation to the graphic 
         can be observed in the frame editor tab of the <a href="Frameset.html">Frameset 
            Editor</a>. Since the default priority of sprites is 0, you might want to 
         set the priority of the layer to -1 if you generally want your sprites to be 
         drawn in front. Interleaving sprites is primarily designed for an isometric 
         view.</p>
      <h3>ScrollRateX, ScrollRateY</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">If the scroll rate of a layer is set to a value other than 0, 
         it will automatically scroll when the map scrolls (for example, when 
         "ScrollSpriteIntoView" occurs). By setting different layers to have different 
         scroll rates, you can achieve a parallax scrolling 3-D-looking effect. For 
         parallax scrolling, layers farther in the background generally have a scroll 
         rate less than 1 but greater than 0, and layers appearing in the foreground (in 
         front of the layer where play is taking place) would have a scroll rate greater 
         than 1. The horizontal scroll rate can be specified independently of the 
         vertical scroll rate. It's reasonable to have a background layer that scrolls 
         at a rate of 0.5 horizontally and 0 vertically (no vertical scrolling).</p>
      <p class="SubPara">If both scroll rates are set to 0, you can still move the layer 
         manually. For example, it's conceivable that you could use a layer like a very 
         large sprite by setting the scroll rate to 0 and moving it manually.</p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>These properties exist primarily to support working with the layer in the 
         design environment.</p>
      <h3>Name</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The name uniquely identifies the layer within its parent map. 
         It only needs to be unique among the layers in the same map. The name must 
         begin with a letter and contain only letters, digits and spaces.</p>
      <h2>Layout</h2>
      <p>These properties determine the size and positioning of the layer in the map.</p>
      <h3>OffsetX, OffsetY</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Layers don't all have to be aligned to the top left corner of 
         the map. By setting these properties, you can position a small layer somewhere 
         in the middle of the map that only draws when that part of the map scrolls into 
         view. The wizard provides a visual way to position a layer in the map. Keep in 
         mind, however, that sprites in a layer cannot normally interact with tiles or 
         sprites in another layer (although rules could conceivably be written to do 
         so), so this should be used only for visual effects.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">OffsetX represents the number of pixels between the left edge 
         of the map and the left edge of the layer. OffsetY represents the number of 
         pixels between the top of the map and the top of the layer. If the offset is 
         set on a layer whose scroll rate is not 1, be aware that this offset represents 
         the number of pixels between the edge of the map and the edge of the layer <strong>
            when the map is scrolled to position 0,0</strong>. Once the map begins 
         scrolling, this offset will change according to the layer's scroll rate. For 
         example, a layer whose OffsetX is set to 10 will be 10 pixels from the left 
         edge of the map to start with. But if ScrollRateX is set to 2 and the map 
         scrolls 5 pixels to the right, then the left edge of the layer will be aligned 
         with the left edge of the map (no offset).</p>
      <h3>SizeInTiles</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This determines how many rows and columns of tiles are stored 
         in the layer. The total number of tiles, of course, ends up being the width 
         multiplied by the height. To determine the number of bytes required to store a 
         layer's tiles, multiply the width by the height, and then by the number of 
         bytes per tile (specified above). This doesn't necessarily specify how big the 
         layer's display is, but by default (when VirtualSize is set to zeros) this does 
         also determine how big the layer appears on the map. See VirtualSize below for 
         more details about a layer's display size and how it interacts with 
         SizeInTiles.</p>
      <h3>VirtualSize</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The display size of a layer can be set independently of the 
         size of its data. VirtualSize defines how many rows and columns of tiles (yes, 
         it's defined in tiles, not pixels) the layer will "pretend" to have. That means 
         that the number of tiles in the layer (SizeInTiles) doesn't necessarily define 
         how far the layer can scroll or where it ends. However, if VirtualSize is set 
         to 0, SizeInTiles does then define the display size as well as the data size. 
         When VirtualSize is larger than SizeInTiles, the data "wraps" so that the data 
         from the left edge of the layer appears at the right when scrolling past the 
         right edge of the SizeInTiles width.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">This can be useful for implementing a repetetive background 
         layer. The SizeInTiles cold be very small like 5x5. Then you can wrap that to 
         fill the whole background by setting the VirtualSize to match that of the other 
         layers in the map. It could also be used to or achieve a wrapping effect by 
         allowing the player to walk off one edge (seeing the right edge of the map) and 
         "secretly" teleport back to the left edge after the edge is no longer visible 
         on the screen. Keep in mind however, that this only affects the layer's tiles. 
         If you put a sprite someplace on the layer, then scroll far off the edge to 
         find an identical area based on the same tiles, the sprite will not appear 
         there.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">This can be seen as either a limitation or a feature. The 
         player can interact with the tiles as if they are in a wrapped world, and 
         removing a tile from one "copy" affects all "copies" of the displayed layer 
         tiles, but the sprites and plans on the layer will only be in one of the copies 
         unless you do extra work to make sure they are always on the "copy" that's 
         currently scrolled into view. That's the limitation. <strong>However</strong>, 
         this can also be used as a feature in some cases. You could create a relatively 
         simple level that appears to wrap infinitely (specify a very large virtual 
         size). This gives you a lot of "level" for a relatively small amount of work 
         and a small amount of data (storage space). Then you can hide a sprite here or 
         a plan there to introduce unique features into various "copies" of the layer 
         without having to duplicate all the tiles in the layer.</p>
      <h3>ZIndex</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This determines where the layer appears within the sequence of 
         the layers in the map. The lowest ZIndex is drawn first, farthest in the 
         background. The highest is drawn last in the foreground. The wizard has a 
         helpful interface to sort the layers into the desired arrangement and adjust 
         the ZIndex properties of multiple layers accordingly.</p>
