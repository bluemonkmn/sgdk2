      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>This document contains important and frequently asked questions and answers 
         that explain aspects of Scrolling Game Development Kit 2 that most users should 
         be familiar with in order to effectively use the program.</p>
      <h2>How Do Plan Rules and Sprite Definition Rules interact?</h2>
      <p>It's important to understand how the rules defined in plans and the rules 
         defined in sprite definitions interact, in order to understand why sprites 
         behave the way they do in many cases. During each loop of the game, all the 
         rules for all plans are executed in sequence (one plan's rules execute, then 
         the next plan). The plans are executed according to their priority (which can 
         be ignored if you don't care about the order in which the plans execute). After 
         all the plan rules have executed, then all the sprite rules execute. The 
         important point is that sprite rules execute after plan rules, so don't expect 
         the effects of a sprite rule to be available during a plan rule's execution 
         until the next frame. By executing the rules in this order, it's possible to 
         have a specific plan provide input to a specific sprite, and then allow the 
         sprite definition to act on the input.</p>
      <h2>How Do I Change the Default Keyboard Settings?</h2>
      <p>Open the "Player.cs" file from the "Source Code" folder in your project. Search 
         for "UpArrow" and you will find the first of many values that you can change to 
         alter the default keyboard layouts. Look at all the keyboard layouts defined in 
         the function for examples of valid values that you can use for key 
         specifications.</p>
      <h2>What's the difference between a Graphic Sheet a Frameset and Tileset? Why do I 
         need them?</h2>
      <p>These 3 objects are used to define graphics at different levels/layers in a 
         project. At the lowest, most basic level are graphic sheets. Practically all 
         graphics that will be used in a game will be contained in a graphic sheet in 
         some form.</p>
      <p>The next level up is the Frameset. A frameset can be used to define how 
         graphics in a graphic sheet can be transformed. This allows you to, for 
         example, draw a single graphic (in a graphic sheet) to represent a creature 
         facing in one direction, but rotate it to 4 different directions in a Frameset 
         and show the creature facing any of these directions in the game. If the 
         original graphic in the graphic sheet is changed, all 4 rotations will 
         implicitly reflect the same change. Another benefit of the Frameset is that the 
         size of the project is smaller because each rotation (or other transformation) 
         doesn't have to be stored as a separate graphic when it can be transformed 
         dynamically by the frameset.</p>
      <p>Finally, a Tileset is another layer of abstraction that is used for defining 
         graphics on a map layer. Since a tile on a layer needs to support the ability 
         to animate or display graphics from multiple frames simultaneously, and a 
         frameset does not allow this, the Tileset is introduced. A tileset associates 
         numeric values stored in the layer's tiles with frames in a frameset, and adds 
         the ability for a single tile number to refer to different frames depending on 
         a counter value (so the tile can animate as the counter changes) and to refer 
         to multiple frames for the same counter value (so a single tile can display 
         multiple graphics overlapping).</p>
      <p>If this seems like a lot of effort to create a simple set of tiles that can be 
         used on a map layer, keep in mind there are shortcuts. If you just want to use 
         a graphic sheet's graphics directly on a map layer, it's relatively easy to 
         create a frameset, select all graphic sheet cells and add them to the frameset, 
         then create a tileset associated with the frameset without any tile mappings. A 
         tileset without any tiles defined will default to associating each numeric 
         value with a frame in the associated frameset at that index. So it's not 
         necessary in a tileset to explicitly map every (or any) tile to a frameset 
         frame because each tile value will, by default, map to a frameset frame.</p>
         <h2>How can I control how sprites react to obstacles?</h2>
         <p>Most sprites will need to walk on solid ground or be prevented from walking
         through solid walls.  Sometimes they even need to be able to walk up hills.  To do
         this, SGDK2 provides "Solidity". The "Solidity" folder in an SGDK2 project contains
         <b>solidity definitions</b> which define how various categories of tiles should be shaped.
         For example, you can have one solidity definition that defines all cloud tiles as
         solid, so some cloud-walking sprites can use that definition and be allowed to walk on
         clouds. Another solidity definition could define the cloud tiles as empty, allowing
         a sprite to walk through clouds unobstructed. Each solidity definition encompasses
         one entire set of rules for all tile categories and shapes to which a particular
         type of sprite needs to respond. Realize that only one solidity definition is
         required to define how a sprite interacts with tiles no matter how many shapes
         or types of tiles you're dealing with. The purpose of multiple solidity definitions
         is to allow different sprites to respond in different ways to the same tiles. Often
         times, only one solidity definition is required in a project.</p>
         <p>A solidity definition consists of a simple list of associations between two other
         objects: <b>tile categories</b> and <b>tile shapes</b>. Each tile category can be
         associated with one tile shape, indicating that every tile in the category should
         assume the specified shape. While a tile category can only be associated with one
         shape, multiple categories can be associated with the same tile shape. So before
         defining solidity, it's necessary to define tile categories. You can include all tiles
         from all tilesets that represent a particular tile shape in a single category. See
         details of the <a href="TileCategories.html">Tile Categories UI</a> for information
         about this process. Tile Shapes, on the other hand are built-in to SGDK2 to some extent.
         A pre-defined set of shapes is provided in the default source code generated for a
         project. You can, however, add your own tile shapes. Each tile shape is defined by
         a set of 4 functions: <ol>
         <li>GetTopSolidPixel - Returns the y-coordinate of the top-most solid pixel within a tile
         given the tile's size and the left and right boundaries of the area in question.</li>
         <li>GetBottomSolidPixel - Returns the y-coordinate of the bottom-most solid pixel
         within a tile given the tile's size and the left and right boundaries of the area in question.</li>
         <li>GetLeftSolidPixel - Returns the x-coordinate of the left-most solid pixel
         within a tile given the tile's size and the top and bottom boundaries of the area in question.</li>
         <li>GetRightSolidPixel - Returns the x-coordinate of the right-most solid pixel
         within a tile given the tile's size and the top and bottom boundaries of the area in question.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>To define a new tile shape, edit TileShapes.cs (in the project's source code folder),
         and start by creating a copy of an existing tile shape with a new
         name. For example, make another copy of the entire SolidTileShape class, and change
         all occurrences of SolidTileShape in the new copy to whatever shape you want to create.
         Then change the implementation in the 4 functions mentioned above to define how your
         shape should behave. After recompiling the project, the new shape should show up in the
         Solidity Definition editor.
         </p>
      <h2>Can I run under Linux?</h2>
      <p>The SGDK2 IDE itself does not run (at least not well) under Linux, but the projects created by
         SGDK2 can run under Linux as of SGDK version 2.1.1. In order to make the projects run
         under Linux some modifications had to be made to the default framework code for SGDK2 projects
         because some of it was relying on Windows-specific behavior.  The new code, however, will work
         universally under Linux and Windows.  (Mainly this code relates to keyboard input, and as of this
         writing, there is no support for Joystick input under Linux, so the new code disables the
         Joystick input under Linux, but leaves it enabled when running under Windows.)</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Make sure you have all the Linux Project support files. These are delivered as a separate
         package because they are relatively large, and some people may not want to download the extra
         content if they don't plan to distribute or run their projects in Linux.</li>
         <li>The easiest method to make a project that runs under Linux is to start with the new
         &quot;Scrolling Game Development Kit Linux Sample&quot; project listed among the available
         new project templates (after the Linux package has been properly installed).
         However, it is possible to convert existing projects to run under Linux as well. The
         Remaining steps will describe this process.</li>
         <li>Load the project to be converted, and select &lt;Blank&gt; from the &quot;Reset Source
         Code&quot; pop-up menu in the file menu. If any of the framework code for the project has been
         modified, these modifications will be lost when resetting the source code.</li>
         <li>After this is taken care of, if your project has sound, the fmodex.dll file in the Source
         Code folder of the SGDK2 project tree needs to be renamed to &quot;libfmodex-4.22.01.so&quot;.
         This is the Linux version of the FMODEx library with which SGDK2 has been tested. To do this,
         open the file for editing and select the Rename command from the file menu. Renaming that
         file actually causes SGDK2 to pick up a different file when generating the project output.
         Instead of copying FMODEx.dll from the directory where SGDK2 is running, it will copy the new
         filename. Of course that assumes that you have to have that file available from the Linux
         support package.</li>
         <li>Notice that after the code was reset, a new file called app.config was added to the Source
         Code folder in the project tree.  There is one configuration setting in here that will force
         Mono (the Linux implementation of the .NET Framework) to re-map every request for FMODEx.dll to
         the new filename.  If you happen to be trying a different version/name of fmod in Linux, you will
         need to modify this configuration file.  When the project compiles, it will be copied to the
         output directory as Project.exe.config where Project.exe is the name of your project executable
         file.</li>
         <li>If you are using any other unmanaged DLLs you may need to perform similar conversions for
         these, using FMODEx.dll as an example. Of course there needs to be a Linux version of each
         available.</li>
      </ol><p>After all this has been done, when you compile your project, the output directory will contain
         all the files necessary to run your project under Linux. It will also contain all the files
         necessary to develop, edit and re-compile your project using MonoDevelop in case further debugging
         is necessary under Linux.  Note that you may no longer be able to run your project in the Windows
         environment simply because FMODEx.dll may no longer exist in the project's output directory.  You
         can manually add it. Also, be aware that you can delete the intermediate output files (a command
         in the File menu) if you don't care to have all the source code available, and then only the
         files to run your project under Linux will remain.</p>
