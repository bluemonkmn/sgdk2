      <h1>Frameset Editor</h1>
      <p>Framesets allow you to re-use the same graphic cells in different orientations 
         at different sizes or through a different color filter. Whether you want to 
         re-use graphics or not, though, you do need to create a Frameset before using 
         any of the graphics in a sprite or tile, which in turn is necessary before 
         seeing the graphics on a map. A single frameset may contain graphics from any 
         number of graphic sheets (yes, that means they can even be different sizes). 
         Performance may be improved, however, if you ensure that the graphics being 
         drawn on the screen at any particular point in time are from a limited number 
         of graphic sheet sources.</p>
      <p>The frameset editor assists you in creating a frameset and manipulating the 
         graphic cells to desired orientations that you plan to use in your project. 
         There are two main features of this screen represented on the two tabs: 
         Frameset and Frame Editor. There are also a number of commands accessible in 
         the Frameset menu.</p>
      <h2>Frameset Tab</h2>
      <h3>Graphic sheet</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The left side of this tab allows you to select graphic cells 
         that will serve as the source graphics for the frames in the frameset. Select a 
         graphic sheet from the dropdown list at the top. The cells within the graphic 
         sheet are displayed in the panel below. You can select which cells you would 
         like to add to the frameset directly, or select a cell and manipulate it before 
         adding it to the frameset.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">In many cases, you'll want to start out by adding many or all 
         frames from a graphic sheet to the frameset. To do this, select the first cell 
         in the graphic sheet by clicking on it, and then hold shift while clicking on 
         the last cell. One all the cells are selected, you can press Ctrl-A or select 
         "Add selected cells to frameset" from the Frameset menu or toolbar.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">If you'd like to manipulate a graphic cell before adding it to 
         the frameset, select a single cell, and then click on the "Frame Editor" tab. 
         From there you can save the manipulated graphic as a new frame on the end of 
         the frameset. (See below for more information about the Frame Editor tab.)</p>
      <h3>Frameset</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The right side of this tab displays the contents of the 
         frameset (all the frames). At the top you can see and change the frameset's 
         name. In the panel below the name, is a list of all the frames. If there are 
         different size frames or frames that are offset differently from the origin, 
         the space allocated for each frame will be larger than the graphics in the 
         frame itself. The properties of the selected frame or frames are displayed at
         the bottom and 
         can be edited directly. These properties include all the information about the 
         frame, which means you can also change the transformation matrix directly on 
         this tab if you know which numbers to put where. The "Frame Editor" tab 
         functions mainly as a convenience to come up with these numbers with a visual 
         editor, but the actual data for the frames transformation is stored and 
         displayed here. Here is a listing of the properties and their descriptions:</p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li>
            <strong>ModuleateAlpha</strong> - Affects how transparently the frame is drawn. 
            A value of 0 results in an invisible frame, a value of 255 results in the frame
            being drawn with its original tranlucency (as defined by the graphic cell), and
            a value of 128 results in a 50% transparent frame.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>ModulateBlue</strong> - Affects how much of the graphic cell's blue is 
            drawn. A value of 0 removes all blue from the image (blue becomes black, white 
            becomes yellow, cyan becomes green, etc). A value of 255 retains all the blue 
            in the image (leaving it unaffected), and a value of 128 removes half the blue 
            from the image (blue becomes dark blue, white becomes light yellow, etc).</li>
         <li>
            <strong>ModulateGreen</strong> - Affects how much of the graphic cell's green 
            is drawn. A value of 0 removes all green from the image (green becomes black, 
            white becomes magenta, cyan becomes blue, etc). A value of 255 retains all the 
            green in the image (leaving it unaffected), and a value of 128 removes half the 
            green from the image (green becomes dark green, white becomes pink, etc).</li>
         <li>
            <strong>ModulateRed</strong> - Affects how much of the graphic cell's red is 
            drawn. A value of 0 removes all red from the image (red becomes black, white 
            becomes cyan, yellow becomes green, etc). A value of 255 retains all the red in 
            the image (leaving it unaffected), and a value of 128 removes half the red from 
            the image (red becomes dark red, white becomes light cyan, etc).</li>
         <li>
            <strong>FrameValue</strong> - Shows the index of the frame within the frameset. 
            You can change this only by dragging the frame to a new position in the 
            frameset.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>dx</strong> - Represents the part of the transformation matrix that 
            determines how far the graphic is offset horizontally when drawn.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>dy</strong> - Represents the part of the transformation matrix that 
            determines how far the graphic is offset vertically when drawn.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>m11</strong> - Represents the part of the transformation matrix that 
            affects horizontal scaling.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>m12</strong> - Represents the part of the transformation matrix that 
            affects vertical shearing.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>m21</strong> - Represents the part of the transformation matrix that 
            affects horizontal shearing.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>m22</strong> - Represents the part of the transformation matrix that 
            affects vertical scaling.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>CellIndex</strong> - This represents the index of the cell in the 
            graphic sheet on which the frame is based. Changing this will cause the 
            selected frame to apply all the same transformations to a different image in the 
            graphic sheet.</li>
         <li>
            <strong>GraphicSheet</strong> - This represents the graphic sheet from which 
            the frame's image is taken. Changing this will use a cell from another graphic 
            sheet with all the same transfomrations applied to this frame.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="SubPara">You can move and copy frames by dragging them. Pressing control 
         while dragging will make a copy of the frame instead of moving it. You can also 
         select multiple frames and mass-change properties. For example, if you want to 
         make a set of frames use graphics from another graphic sheet (at the same 
         indexes they're using now), you could select the frames, then select the new 
         graphic sheet.</p>
      <p class="SubPara"><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li>
            Changing CellIndex to a number beyond the number of cells in the selected 
            graphic sheet will result in an error.</li>
         <li>
            Changing GraphicSheet to a sheet that doesn't have cells numbering up to 
            CellIndex will also result in an error.</li>
         <li>
            Moving frames around in the frame sequence may cause undesirable results on 
            tiles and sprites that use this frameset. If you move frame 1 to frame 3, then 
            anything referencing frames 1, 2 and 3 will now refer to former frames 2, 3 and 
            1 respectively. The frame indexes in referring objects are not changed to 
            reflect new frame positions. The former frame 2 is now at position 1, and 
            anything referencing frame 1 will display what used to be frame 2.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="SubPara">See information about menu commands below for more information 
         about mass-changing/copying frames with the Frame Remapping wizard.</p>
      <h2><a name="FrameEditTab">Frame Editor Tab</a></h2>
      <p>The frame editor tab allows you to visually manipulate the shape and 
         orientation of a graphic cell and update a frameset frame with the results. If 
         you select a graphic cell on the left half of the Frameset tab before switching 
         to this tab, then saving the frame will add a new frame to the frameset. 
         Othwerwise the edited frame will be saved back to the frame that was selected 
         before switching to the Frame Editor tab.</p>
      <h3>Coordinate Preview</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This view covering the main portion of the frame editor tab 
         shows how the graphic will appear relative to the coordinates at which it is 
         drawn (its origin). By moving the mouse over the graphic you can drag it to a 
         new position relative to this origin. Most sprites and tiles are drawn below 
         and to the right of their origin, but here you can designate certain graphics 
         to draw beyond those usual boundaries. By moving the mouse over the drag 
         handles on the surrounding frame, and dragging them, you can scale the frame to 
         a new size. Similar operations can be achieved by entering specific numbers in 
         the controls below or selecting commands from the context menu.</p>
      <h3>Rotation</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Below the Coordinate preview is a slider that you can drag to 
         any position to rotate the graphic from a range of -179 degrees to +180 
         degrees. If you know a specific rotation that you'd like to apply to the 
         graphic you can also enter it in the text box below the rotation slider. 
         Rotation can be applied either around the origin or around the center of the 
         image. Generally rotation is desired around the center of the image, but you 
         can un-check the box if you want to rotate (by slider or text entry) around the 
         origin. Positive rotations are clockwise and negative rotations are 
         counter-clockwise.</p>
      <p class="SubPara">Note that if you scale or move the image after rotating, all 
         the controls are reset (but the transformation is retained), so make sure your 
         rotation is correct before proceeding with other transformations. This is done 
         because scaling and translation do not always behave intuitively when they are 
         being applied at the same time as rotation, therefore the rotation is applied 
         before any other types of operations are introduced.</p>
      <h3>Scaling</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Below the rotation controls you can manually enter a precice 
         scaling value. Negative values for "X Scale" will flip the image horizontally 
         accross the origin. Negative values for "Y Scale" will flip the image 
         vertically accross the origin. Note that when the image is flipped accross one 
         axis and you are applying a rotation on top of that, rotation occurs in the 
         opposite direction.</p>
      <h3>Offset</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">At the bottom of the Frame Editor you can enter specific 
         offsets to move the frames position relative to its origin. These numbers are 
         measured in pixels. Entering fractional values will cause the frame to draw 
         anti-aliased "between" pixel positions.</p>
      <h3>Background Frame</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">When the "Background Frame" item in the view menu is checked, a
      floating window containing all the frameset's frames is visible on this tab. Selecting
      a frame from this window will display that frame according to its defined position
      along with the frame being edited in the frame editor. This can be useful for positioning
      a frame relative to another existing frame.  To hide the background frame, un-check the
      "Background Frame" item in the view menu.</p>
      <h3>Reset</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This button will clear all matrix transformations applied to 
         the frame. Note that this does not just reset the image to the state it was in 
         when you entered the Frame Editor, but to the completely un-transformed graphic 
         cell.</p>
      <h3>OK</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Apply the current transformations and return to the Frameset 
         tab.</p>
      <h3>Cancel</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Return to the Frameset tab without applying any 
         transformations.</p>
      <p>Note, if you return to the Frameset tab without clicking OK or Cancel, you will 
         be prompted to update or discard the changes.</p>
      <h2>View Menu</h2>
      <p>A couple items in the view menu apply specifically to the Frameset Editor</p>
      <h3>Cell Borders</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Displays dashed borders around the graphics in the Graphic Sheet pane on the left to clarify the size of each graphic cell and the position of the graphics within it.</p>
      <h3>Frame Borders</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Displays dashed borders around the graphics in the Frameset pane on the right to clarify the size of each frame and the position of the graphics within it.</p>
      <h3>Background Frame</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Shows or hides the floating "Background Frame" window on the <a href="#FrameEditTab">Frame Editing Tab</a>, as well as any currently active background frame selection.</p>
      <h3>Frame Sizing Border</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Shows or hides the sizable border drawn around the frame in the <a href="#FrameEditTab">Frame Editing Tab</a>. The frame is still sizable and movable, but the border is hidden, allowing better visibility of the background frame.</p>
      <h2>Frameset Menu</h2>
      <h3>Add Selected Cells to Frameset</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Add the cells currently selected in the graphic sheet pane of 
         the Frameset tab to the frameset without immediately applying any 
         transformations.</p>
      <h3>Delete Selected Frames</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Removes the currently selected frames in the Frameset pane from 
         the frameset. If your attempt to remove frames would result in a tileset or 
         sprite definition referring to frame indexes beyond the bounds of the new 
         frameset, you will be notified and unable to delete the frames until you 
         address the issue in the appropriate tileset or sprite definition. Note that 
         deleting frames causes all the frame indexes after the deleted frames to 
         change, which can impact the related tilesets and sprite definitions 
         undesirably. Therefore, if you have tilesets and sprite definitions based on 
         the frameset, it's recommended that you simply leave the frame unused (possibly 
         mark it with a particular cell), instead of deleting it. Then if/when you want 
         to insert or add a frame, re-use that unused frame for a new purpose.</p>
      <h3>Transform Selected Frames</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The commands in this menu can be used on either the Frameset 
         tab or the Frame Editor tab to apply pre-defined transformations to frames. On 
         the Frameset tab you can select one or more frames and immediately apply a 
         transformation to them without visiting the Frame Editor tab if it's a 
         transformation represented by one of the commands in this menu. On the Frame 
         Editor tab, the transformation will apply to the frame being edited. Most of 
         the commands are self-explanatory; here is a list:</p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li>
            Horizontal Flip
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Accross origin</li>
               <li>
                  Across center</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Vertical Flip
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Across origin</li>
               <li>
                  Across center</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Double Width</li>
         <li>
            Double Height</li>
         <li>
            Halve Width</li>
         <li>
            Halve Height</li>
         <li>
            Move Left 1/2 Width</li>
         <li>
            Move Right 1/2 Width</li>
         <li>
            Move Up 1/2 Height</li>
         <li>
            Move Down 1/2 Height</li>
         <li>
            Clockwise 90 Degrees
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Around origin</li>
               <li>
                  Around Center</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Counter-clockwise 90 degrees
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Around origin</li>
               <li>
                  Around center</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Custom... - Switches to the Frame Editor tab</li>
         <li>
            Reset - Clears all matrix transformations for the selected frame(s), resulting 
            in the un-transformed graphic cell being drawn.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Frame Remapping Wizard</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This wizard walks you through the steps of copying or remapping 
         frames in a frameset to use different graphics. This wizard can perform the 
         following operations:</p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li>
            Change the graphic sheet referenced by frames.</li>
         <li>
            Offset the graphic sheet cell index referenced by frames.</li>
         <li>
            Set the graphic sheet cell index referenced by frames.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="SubPara">The results of the wizard can either change existing frames in 
         place or copy the frames to the end of the current frameset or a new frameset.</p>
      <h3>Frame Tweening Wizard</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This wizard walks you through the steps of creating a series of
         frames with a continuous progression of rotation, offset or scaling values. This
         wizard can perform the following operations:</p>
      <ul class="SubList">
         <li>
            Append a series of frames based on a progression of transformations applied
            to a graphic cell. The series of transformations is based on the parameters
            specified for two endpoints, and the number of frames to generate is specified
            in the wizard.</li>
         <li>
            Update a series of existing frames by transforming them according to a series
            of transformations. The series of transformations is based on the parameters
            specified for two endpoints.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Edit Graphic Cell...</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">You can jump directly to the graphic sheet editor to change the 
         graphics used by a particular frame by selecting this command from the Frameset 
         menu or the context menu. Note that since you are editing the cell, edits will 
         affect all frames that reference the same graphic cell.</p>
      <p>The context menu available with a right-click in the frames panel in the 
         Frameset tab or in the Frame Editor displays all the items from the "Transform 
         Selected Frames" menu and the "Edit Graphic Cell..." menu item for easy access.</p>
