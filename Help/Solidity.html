      <h1>Solidity</h1>
      <p>The term "Solidity" is used to refer to a set of rules that determines which 
         shapes are applied to which tiles. Each sprite can have its own solidity 
         setting, referring to a particular Solidity object defined in the project. This 
         will affect whether the sprite can walk straight through a tile, whether it 
         walks up it like a hill or whether it hits it and stops dead in its tracks.</p>
      <p>Solidity is based on tile categories, so tile categories must be defined before 
         any useful solidity information can be created. The function of this window is 
         to associate tile categories with tile shapes to form a single named "Solidity" 
         object that sprites can refer to as a single set of rules about what is solid 
         and what is not. Note that assigning a tile category to a shape does not apply 
         globally, but only within the scope of a Solidity definition. Therefore, it's 
         possible to have one solidity object that defines tiles in a "water" category 
         as solid, and another solidity object that defines tiles in the "water" 
         category as empty. This would allow, for example, a "fish" sprite to use one 
         solidity object to be able to travel freely through water, and a "player" 
         sprite to be blocked by water. It's even possible to change this solidity 
         during the game so that, for example, if the player receives an item to allow 
         it to walk on water, it can switch to the other solidity definition.</p>
      <p>To create a new solidity definition, right-click on the "Solidity" folder in 
         the project tree and select "New", or select the folder, and then choose "New 
         Object" from the file menu. To edit an existing solidity object, double-click 
         it in the project tree, or select it and choose "Properties" from the view menu 
         or "Edit" from the context (right-mouse) menu.</p>
      <h2>Name</h2>
      <p>Each solidity definition must have a name unique among all solidity definitions 
         in the project. Names must begin with a letter and contain only letters, digits 
         and spaces.</p>
      <h2>Category</h2>
      <p>Select a tile category whose tiles will be defined by this row. Any tiles that 
         are not included in a category listed in this column will default to an empty 
         shape, allowing sprites to travel through them unimpeded. A particular tile 
         category can only be specified once per solidity definition. Attempting to add 
         multiple rows with the same tile category will result in an error message.</p>
      <h2>Shape</h2>
      <p>Select a shape that will be associated with all tiles in the specified 
         category. The list of available shapes are determined by the shapes defined in 
         TileShapes.cs in the project's Source Code folder. That means that it's 
         possible to create custom shapes specifically for a project by adding new 
         classes to this file. This must be done with care, however. An improper shape 
         definition can result in inconsistent and unwanted behavior.</p>
      <p>Note that in order for the list of shapes to be available in the dropdown list, 
         the environment needs to compile the project. Therefore, you must make sure 
         that some minimum number of steps have been completed in order to qualify the 
         project as compilable before you can start defining solidity. Pressing F7 or 
         selecting "Generate Project" from the file menu can help you find incomplete 
         areas of the project.</p>
