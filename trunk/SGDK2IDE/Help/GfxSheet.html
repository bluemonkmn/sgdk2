      <h1>Graphic Sheet Properties</h1>
      <p>A graphic sheet is an array of graphic "cells" all the same size, stored in a 
         single image with a fixed number of rows and columns. Almost all graphics in a 
         game are based on the graphics defined in a graphic sheet. The only readily 
         apparent exceptions would be some of the text (in cases where text drawing 
         functions are used instead of drawing the text into graphic cells) and the 
         window frame and secondary windows (options and about dialogs) when playing the 
         game in windowed mode.</p>
      <p>Before graphics can be edited, some parameters must be provided about the 
         layout of the graphics so the environment knows, for example, how large they 
         will be. This window is used to supply these parameters before proceeding to 
         the <a href="GfxEdit.html">graphics editor</a>. These parameters can also be 
         updated later, but be careful when doing so because this can drastically affect 
         the graphics.</p>
      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <p>The properties of the graphic sheet are edited in the main grid area of the 
         window.</p>
      <h3>BackgroundColor</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This defines a solid color that will initially fill all the 
         graphics. For graphics that will be used on the background layer, an opaque 
         color should be chosen. For graphics that will be used in a foreground layer, 
         especially sprites, choosing "Transparent" from the "Web" tab of the dropdown 
         is probably best. If the dropdown does not display the desired color, the color 
         can also be specified by typing a comma-separated list of values to specify the 
         Alpha, Red, Green and Blue components of the color respectively. For example, 
         to specify a half-transparent red color, enter "128,255,0,0" into this control.</p>
      <h3>Name</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">The name of a graphic sheet must be unique among all graphic 
         sheets in the project. Names must begin with a letter and contain only letters, 
         digits and spaces.</p>
      <h3>CellHeight, CellWidth</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">These properties define the size of each cell in the sheet. The 
         size is specified in pixels. The size of the overall sheet can be calculated by 
         multiplying this size by the number of rows and columns (there is no padding 
         between graphics). Changing these values on an existing graphic sheet 
         (containing graphics) is not advised except to correct an alignment problem 
         with an imported graphic sheet image because changing this value does not move 
         or change any of the graphics, so the divisions between the tiles will all be 
         shifted and will likely no longer line up with the graphics on the sheet.</p>
      <h3>Columns, Rows</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">These properties define how many rows and columns of graphic 
         cells are in the graphic sheet. Multiplying these together will result in the 
         overall number of cells. If this result is greater than 255, and you want to 
         use each graphic as a separate tile, the layers that use the tileset based on 
         this graphic sheet will need to specify more than 1 byte per tile. Use care 
         when changing these values on an existing graphic sheet. If the number of rows 
         or columns is reduced, the sheet is simply cropped and any graphics in the 
         removed rows and columns will be lost. And if the number of columns is changed 
         on a graphic sheet that is already being referenced by a frameset, the graphics 
         referenced by the frameset may be thrown off because of the changed indexing. 
         The graphic cells are indexed in order from the top left corner of the sheet, 
         across all the columns of the first row and then down to the next row. So take, 
         for example, a frameset frame that refers to cell index 5 in a graphic sheet 
         that has 2 rows and 3 columns (each 32x32 pixels). That corresponds to the 
         graphic in the third column of the second row of the sheet (the last cell). 
         Then assume that a new column is added to the graphic sheet. None of the 
         graphics are moved; the sheet image is just widened by 32 pixels. Now cell 
         index number 5 refers to the second column of the second row, which is a 
         different image. So it's best to settle on a reasonable number of columns for a 
         graphic sheet, and if cells need to be added or if the size needs to be 
         reduced, add and remove rows, not columns.
      </p>
      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <p>All the commands available in this window are represented as buttons along the 
         side.</p>
      <h3>Add/Update</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Depending on whether a new graphic sheet is being added or an 
         existing one updated, this button will read "Add" or "Update". The changes are 
         not committed to the project until this button is clicked.</p>
      <h3>Export</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This will export the graphic sheet in SGDK2 format for use in 
         an SGDK2 graphics library or for use in other projects. (SGDK2 format is simply 
         a project file format. The format is exactly the same as that of a project, but 
         only the exported data is included rather than all the components required to 
         make a compilable project.) The credits from the current project are exported 
         into the graphic sheet file, so make sure they are appropriate to the graphic 
         sheet being exported. Any project that imports the exported graphic sheet will 
         also import the credits associated with it and merge them with the project's 
         credits.</p>
      <h3>Decapsulate</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">This is an advanced feature and should not be commonly used in 
         projects. Decapsulating a graphic sheet will save the image as an independent 
         file and temporarily store only a reference to that file within the project. 
         The purpose of this feature is to allow a single copy of a graphic sheet to be 
         referenced by multiple separate template files. Without this feature, each 
         template would have to embed its own copy of the graphic sheet's image, which 
         could result in lots of unnecessary overhead. When a graphic sheet is imported 
         into another project, it is re-encapsulated (a copy of the decapsulated image 
         is embedded in the project that imported the graphic sheet). Furthermore, if 
         any modifications are made to a graphic sheet that has been decapsulated, the 
         modified image is re-embedded into the project and there is no longer a 
         reference to the external file. The path to the decapsulated graphic sheet is 
         relative to the location of the SGDK2 file containing it. A graphic sheet 
         cannot be decapsulated until the graphic sheet has been added to the project, 
         and the project containing it has been saved.</p>
      <h3>Cancel</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">Any un-commited changes are discarded and the window is closed. 
         If a graphic sheet was being added, it is discarded and no new graphic sheet 
         will exist in the project.</p>
