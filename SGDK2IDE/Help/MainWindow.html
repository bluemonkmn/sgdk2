      <h1>Main Window</h1>
      <p>Scrolling Game Development Kit 2 is a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application,
      meaning that all activity takes place in windows embedded in one top-level window. Any
      number of child windows may be running simultaneously within the main window. This
      application is also referred to as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) because
      many various tasks for designing and developing a game are combined in this single interface.
      the term IDE is sometimes used in this documentation to distinguish the design environment
      from the run-time environment (windows that are part of the actual game produced by this
      program).</p>
      <p>The details of using individual features of the program are documented separately, each
      on its own help page.  The help for any particular window is generally available simply
      by pressing the F1 key when that window is active.  A few of the features of the program
      are universal and do not apply to the individual windows/objects that can be edited within
      the main window.  These are documented here.</p>      
      <h2>Project Tree</h2>
      <p>On the left side of the main window is a project tree that provides an overview
      of the entire project.  Creating new objects, editing existing objects, and deleting objects
      depends on this tree view. To create a new object, select the folder associated with the type
      of object you want to create, and then select "New Object" from the file menu, or right-click
      on the folder and select "New" from the pop-up menu.  To edit an existing object, there are a
      number of options:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Double click on the item in the tree view that you want to edit.</li>
      <li>Select the item you want to edit and press the F4 key.</li>
      <li>Select the item you want to edit and select "Properties" from the view menu.</li>
      <li>Right-click in the item you want to edit and select "Edit" from teh pop-up menu.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To delete an item, select it, and then select "Delete Object" from the file menu,
      or right-click on it and select "Delete" from the pop-up menu.  Notice that the pop-up menu
      and file menu also provide and "Import From..." command. Similar to the new command, you can
      also create new objects by importing them from external .SGDK2 files (make sure to choose the
      import command from the correct folder). The "Import From..." command can be used to import
      Sprite Definitions, Source Code, Graphic Sheets, Tilesets and Framesets.</p>
      <h2>Menus</h2>
      <p>Beyond the menu items designed for use with the project tree, there are a number of
      other menu commands available universally.</p>
      <h3>File</h3>
      <p class="SubPara">
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr><th>Menu Item</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr><td>New Project</td><td>Clear any existing project from memory and create a new project.
      This menu cannot be selected directly, you must select a "template" from the pop-up menu. The
      first item in the pop-up menu is the "&lt;blank&gt;" template which creates a new project
      based on the source code stored internally in the IDE (in case all your templates have been
      deleted). The "Default" template is the template that is automatically loaded when the IDE
      starts up.  If you want to customize the default project that is loaded when the IDE starts
      up you can overwrite Default.sgdk2 in the Library\Projects folder.  The only difference
      between creating a new project from a project template and loading the project using the
      "Open" project command is that the "New" command treats the project as an un-saved project
      and prompts for a filename for the new project before it is compiled or saved.  The format
      of a template and a project is identical.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Open Project</td><td>Open an existing SGDK2 project for editing. Normally, all data
      relating to the project is contained in a single file, so you do not need to be concerned
      about where the project is opened from. An SGDK2 file is mostly independent of any other
      files and can be freely moved.  The main exception is external DLL references such as
      FMODEX.dll, but many of these will be picked up from the directory where the IDE is running
      or from the system path and don't need to be kept with the SGDK2 file.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Save Project</td><td>Save the currently loaded project to a file. If the project was
      already saved or loaded from an existing file, it is saved to the same file, but if it is a
      new project that hasn't been saved, you will be prompted for a new file name. When specifying
      the location for the project, keep in mind that when the project is compiled, the compiled
      files will be generated in a folder whose name is the same as the project name without the
      .sgdk2 extension.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Save As...</td><td>This performs the same function as Save, but will always prompt
      for a location.  If the project was already saved or loaded, the original copy is left as
      is and any modifications that have been made are saved only to the new file. Since SGDK2
      files are all-encompasing containers for game data, all data associated with the original
      project is effectively copied into the newly specified file.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Run Project</td><td>Compile and run the currently loaded project. For details on
      the process of compiling, see "Generate Project" below. This performs the same action as
      Generate Project, and then proceeds to run the game.  The game cannot be compiled again
      while it is still running because the executable file will be locked by the operating
      system.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Run Project in Debug Mode</td><td>This performs the same acton as "Run Project",
      but turns on a debug switch in the code that affects a few things. First of all, any
      validations that are performed only in debug mode will display messages is the validation
      fails. The most common example of this is trying to perform some action with an inactive
      sprite. Messages about this problem will only appear in debug mode. Another effect is an
      FPS (frames per second) will be displayed in the top left corner of the display while the
      game is running. Furthermore any debug messages that are output by the <a href=
      "ms-its:SGDK2 Coding Reference.chm::/GeneralRules.LogDebugLabel.html">LogDebugLabel</a> and
      <a href="ms-its:SGDK2 Coding Reference.chm::/GeneralRules.LogDebugValue.html">LogDebugValue</a>
      functions. You can also add your own debug code that only executes when the debug switch is
      on by using the #if DEBUG" precompiler statement and/or the
      [System.Diagnostics.Conditional("DEBUG")] attribute, both of which are demonstrated in
      GameForm.cs in the Source Code folder of the default project.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Reset Source Code</td><td>Resets all the built-in code in the Source Code folder
      (code that has an internally stored version in the IDE -- see <a href="CodeEdit.html">Source
      Code Editor</a> for details). Each built-in code object in the Source Code folder will be
      overwritten with the IDE's copy (or re-created if it does not exist). This is useful for
      ensuring that the built-in source code objects in the current project are in sync with what
      the IDE is expecting. The build-in code can be changed to a certain extent, but there are
      certain expectations that the code generator has, and if these are not met, then the project
      will not compile. Using this command is the easiest way to restore at least the built-in
      code to a functional state. One way that the built-in code can diverge is by manual editing.
      If you edit the code badly and can't restore it to a functional state, you may want to reset
      it. Another way is if a new version of SGDK2 is released that has different built-in code
      that is not compatible with oilder built-in code. Resetting the older project to use the newer
      built-in code may be the easiest way to upgrade the project, but it would also lose any
      customizations that were made to the built-in code.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Generate Project</td><td>This uses all the data contained in the project to create
      an actual runnable game. There are two main steps to this process. First all the code is
      generated based on the contents of the Source Code folder and the objects defined in the
      project. Then the C# compiler provided with the .NET framework compiles the project. All this
      takes place in a folder whose name is that of the SGDK2 file without the SGDK2 extension.
      Note that during the process, a ".csproj" file is also created so that, if you have Visual
      Studio, you can load the project into a more featureful debug environment if you want to
      see how the project works or what may be going wrong with it.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Delete Intermediate Output Files</td><td>Deletes all the source code and similar files
      that were generated by the Generate Project command. This essentially deletes all the files
      from the output folder that do not need to be delivered when distributing your game.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Delete All Output Files</td><td>Deletes all files created by the Generate Project
      command. If the folder is empty, the output folder will also be deleted. This might be handy
      if you have extra/custom files in the folder and want to sort out all the generated files
      from the extra files.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>(Recent File List)</td><td>The 5 most recently loaded projects are displayed near the
      bottom of the file menu for easy access (if you want to re-load a project you were recently
      working on).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Exit</td><td>Quit the program. This does not close any games that may be running, just
      the IDE itself.</td></tr>
      </tbody>

      <p class="SubPara">
      The Unsaved Changes command in this menu is sort of a diagnostic/debug feature which may be
      of limited use to actual users. It will show information about which data has changed since
      the project was last saved/loaded. The format is not very user friendly, but should be
      comprehensible with a little effort and understanding. The contents of the window basically
      show a list of each "row" of data in the project that has changed. Since every piece of data
      in a project is stored in a .NET dataset, it exists in a "row" somewhere, and this window
      shows the identity of rows that have some content that has changed, but doesn't go into a
      lot of detail about the specific changes.
      </p>
      
      <p>The remainder of the menus in the main window are self-explanatory as they follow conventions
      common to all Windows applications.</p>
