      <h1>Tutorial 1 - Functional Game Without Importing</h1>
      This page describes some steps to get a simple game running in SGDK2 without 
      importing any external data. This is a very simple game, but steps through a 
      few features of SGDK2 that are interesting and important to understand in the 
      process of learning SGDK2.  Keep in mind that creating a game from scratch 
      (without importing anything) may look significantly more complicated than 
      importing some key pieces (especially sprite definitions), but in the interest 
      of completeness, this tutorial will expose all the details of re-creating 
      this data rather than simply importing it.

         <li>
         Start with the new/default project (select "&lt;Blank&gt;" from the File-&gt;New menu if 
         necessary).
         <li>
      Create a new graphic sheet.
      <OL>
         <LI>
            Right-click on "Graphic Sheets" and select "New", <B>or</B>
         select "Graphic Sheets" and select "New Object" from the File menu or toolbar.
         <li>
         Enter "My Graphics" as the sheet name.
         <li>
         Click the "Add" button or press Enter a second time.
         <li>
            Double-Click on the new "Edit Images" node that appeared under "My Graphics" in 
            the tree, <b>or</b>
         select it and press F4 (or select "Properties" from the View menu).
         <li>
            Select "Flood Fill" from the tools menu, <b>or</b>
         the paint bucket from the toolbar.
         <li>
         Select dark blue as the "Solids" color from the lower-left corner of the color 
         palette window in the graphics editor by left-clicking on it.
         <li>
         Click in the magnified edit area at the upper left of the graphics editor.
         <li>
         Click the "Store to Selected Cell(s)" button in the Cell Manager window. This 
         will be our background tile.
         <li>
         Select the next cell in the Cell Manager (the one to the right of the first), 
         and click "Load Selected Cell(s)".
         <li>
         Repeat the previous 5 steps with Green as the "Solids" color. This will be our 
         solid "wall" tile.
         <li>
            Select the custom tool button (this looks like a star by default), <STRONG>or</STRONG>
         select "Star" from the "Custom Tool" menu in the "Tools" menu.
         <li>
            Select the outlined shapes button from the toolbar, <B>or</B>
         select "Draw Outlined Shapes" from the tools menu. This will ensure that the 
         star we're about to draw will have an outline.
         <li>
            Select the gradient fill button from the toolbar, <STRONG>or</STRONG>
         select "Gradient Fills" from the tools menu. This will make a smooth gradient 
         star from the fill in the center to the outline color around the edge.
         <li>
         Click the yellow color in the recently used colors list to set the solid color 
         to yellow.
         <li>
         Move the mouse to a coordinate of approximately "15.5,17" in the magnified view 
         (the coordinate is displayed in the magnified view's title bar) and drag a star 
         upward to about 15.5, 1.5. Since the last step in the process above was to load 
         an empty cell, you should be doing this on a transparent background represented 
         ad grey and white diamonds.
         <li>
         Store the tile in the third cell by clicking "Store to selected Cell(s)". This 
         will be the image for an item the player will pick up.
         <li>
         Select the fourth cell (the next empty cell) and load it with "Load Selected 
         Cells(s)".
         <li>
            Click the drop-down arrow next to the custom tool button and select "Triangle" 
            from it, <b>or</b>
         select "Triangle" from the "Custom Tool" menu in the "Tools" menu.
         <li>
         Left-click on Red in the recent colors list to select it as the "Solids" color.
         <li>
         Move the mouse to a coordinate of approximately "15.5, 20" in the magnified 
         view and drag a red triangle shape upward to about 15.5, 3.
         <li>
         Store the triangle in the fourth cell (the next empty cell) by clicking "Store 
         to Selected Cell(s)". This will be the image for our player sprite.

      Display the sprite definition editor for the "Player" sprite definition, by 
      double-clicking it, right-clicking it and selecting "Edit", or selecting it and 
      pressing F4 or selecting "Properties" from the view menu.
      <LI>
      Select the "Rules" tab.
      <LI>
         Add a new rule by selecting "Add Rule" from the "Sprite Definition" menu, or by 
         selecting the New button from the toolbar in the Rules tab.

      Select "(int)Sprites.Player.State.Norm0" in the "FirstState" combo box.
      <LI>
      Type "72" in the "StateCount" combo box. You may recall this is the number of
      states we created for the player.
      <LI>
      Type "state+1" into the "NewState" combo box. Adding to the state rotates it
      to the left, while subtracting rotates it to the right. Keep in mind that you
      could normally import a rotating sprite instead of having to know 
      these parameters, but this tutorial will show you all the details.
      <LI>
      Select "state" from the "Output To" combo box. This ensures that, after the new
      state is calculated, it is set as the player sprite's current state. Note that
      we use CalculateRotatedState instead of simply adding or subtracting 1 to ensure
      that the state never goes outside the range of 0 to 71.
      <LI>
         Check the "End If/End While" checkbox to end the first rule's condition.</LI></OL>

      dropdown.
      <LI>
      Select the "Parameters" tab.
      <LI>
      In the first row of the grid, type "My inertia".  This adds a parameter to 
      this sprite type that can be specified on each sprite instance in the map 
      editor.
      <LI>
      Switch back to the "Rules" tab
      <LI>

         Create a new layer.
         <OL>
      <LI>
      Locate the "Layers" folder under "Level 1" in the project tree and create a new 
      layer in it.
      <LI>
      Enter "My Layer" for the layer name.
      <LI>
      Note the deault selection of "My Tileset" for the Tileset, and the default 
      values of 100 and 15 for the layer width and height.
      <LI>
         Click Add.</LI></OL>
      <LI>
         Edit the layer
         <OL>
      <LI>
      The layer editor should appear automatically when the layer is added, but if
      you need to re-display it, you can locate the "Editor" node inside the new
      "My Layer" node in the project tree, and double-click it.
      <LI>
      Scroll to the bottom of the layer
      <LI>
      Select the green tile from the "Tiles" pane
      <LI>
      Draw a floor accross the bottom of this layer by moving the mouse to tile 
      coordinates "0,14" and dragging a straight row of green tiles to the right edge 
      of the window. The tile coordinate is displayed in the map editor's status bar.
      <LI>
      Scroll to the right and repeat the previous step until there is a green floor 
      across the entire bottom of the map.
      <LI>
      Select the star tile from the Tiles pane.
      <LI>
      Place the star on the blue background somewhere. Notice that it has a black 
      (actually transparent) background. If we want to create tiles like this on the 
      same layer as the background, they need to have their own background. We'll do 
      this in the next step, "Define a tile mapping."
      <LI>
      Select the "Sprites" tab.
      <LI>
      Select "Add Sprites".
      <LI>
      Select "&lt;All&gt;" from the dropdown list of sprite categories.
      <LI>
      Select the red triangle sprite.
      <LI>
      In the sprite properties pane at the bottom of the sprites pane, enter "1" into 
      the "Priority" field, and press Enter.  This ensures that the sprite will 
      draw after the layer it's in instead of before or instead of interleaving with 
      the tiles. You probably won't have to change the default value because it is already
      1, but be aware of this value for controlling how sprites draw.
      <LI>
      Scroll to the left end of the map and click the sprite onto the layer's blue 
      background somewhere.  Notice that the sprite doesn't need to worry about 
      the background because it is drawn independently of the tiles in the layer, 
      rather than replacing tiles in the layer.
      <LI>
      Select "Select Sprites" from the sprites pane.
      <LI>
      Click on the sprite that was just added to select it.
      <LI>
      In the sprite properties pane, select "Standard" in the "Solidity" field.  
      Defining the solidity on the individual sprite instance allows different 
      instances of the same sprite definition to react differently to map solidity or 
      allows the same instance to act differently at different times.
      <LI>
      In the sprite properties pane, enter "98" for "My inertia".  Notice that 
      this is the parameter added to the sprite definition for this sprite type.
      <LI>
         Close the map editor.</LI></OL>
      <LI>
         Define a tile mapping.
         <OL>
      <LI>
      Double-click "My Tileset" in the Tilesets folder (or select it and open it with 
      F4 or the Properties command).
      <LI>
      Select the star tile in the bottom pane and notice that its frameset index is 
      #2 in the status bar.
      <LI>
      In order to replace this tile with one that has a background, we'll override 
      tile number 2: Select "New Tile" from the Tileset menu or the toolbar next to 
      the "Mapped Tiles" dropdown box.
      <LI>
      Select "Custom", enter "2" into the Tile Value field, and click OK.
      <LI>
      Select and drag the blue frame from the bottom pane to the top pane and drop it 
      on the left side of the star. Alternatively, you can select the blue tile in 
      the bottom frame and press Ctrl-A to add it to the tile.  If it gets added 
      after the star, then select the star frame in the bottom pane and add that 
      (with Ctrl-A) too.  Then select the first star in the top pane and press 
      the delete key to delete that frame from the tile.
      <LI>
      With only the blue frame in the top pane selected, replace the default value of 
      "1" in the "Repeat Count" field with a "0". This causes the blue background 
      frame to be merged with the star frame so they display at the same time.
      <LI>
      Feel free to go back to the map editor (double-click on "Editor" under the "My 
      Layer" node in the project tree) and verify that the star has a blue background 
      now.
      <LI>
         Close the Tileset Editor.</LI></OL>
      <LI>
         Add a new plan to select a player sprite (map keyboard input to the sprite and 
         scroll it into view).
         <OL>
      <LI>
      Add a new plan to the "Plans" folder under Maps - Level 1 - Layers - My Layer.
      <LI>
      Enter the name "Manage player sprite" in the Name field of the plan.

         Select m_ParentLayer.m_Player_1 from the Target dropdown list.</LI></OL>
      <LI>
         Add another new rule named "Scroll player sprite into view".  Note: this 
         could be done on the sprite definition instead (so you don't have to repeat 
         this on every map) but if you want multiple players, it's better to see that it 
         can be done here too.

      <P>At this point you should be able to move the player around using the arrow keys 
         and see the map scroll (although you might not notice it scrolling until you 
         get to the star because the graphics are so uniform).  If you'd like to 
         further enhance the game to pick up the star, add some walls and introduce 
         gravity, you can proceed with the steps below.  After each step you can 
         run the game again to see your progress (if any is visible) by pressing 
         F5.  Note that you will be un-able to re-compile (re-run) your game if
