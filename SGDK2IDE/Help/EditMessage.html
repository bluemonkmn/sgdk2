  <h1>Message Editor</h1>
  <p>
    When you use the <a href="html/M_GeneralRules_ShowMessage.htm">ShowMessage</a>
    function, only one parameter is provided,
    and it specifies all the content of the message.  Trying to lay out the
    content of the message manually can be tedious, so the message editor is
    provided to help edit message content while showing a preview that
    approximates how the message will appear at runtime.  This editor
    can be accessed by selecting &lt;Message Editor...&gt; from the
    parameter's dropdown list.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Tileset:</b> Before any preview will be displayed, you must select the
    tileset that the preview will use.  If you are using the
    <a href="html/M_GeneralRules_SetMessageFont.htm">SetMessageFont</a> function
    to set the font for the message, you should select the same tileset here
    as you specified for SetMessageFont.  If not, select the first tileset, which
    is the default.  Because the execution of rules cannot be predicted at design
    time, there may be more than one tileset that could be the active font when
    ShowMessage executes, so it's up to you to select the tileset with which the
    message preview will operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Message:</b> This is the parameter value exactly is it appeared in the
    sprite definition window.  It represents the content of the message as a
    quoted string.  If any part of the message is not in quotes, the message
    preview will display "[Variable]" for that portion of the message, and you
    should be aware that the preview will not be accurate because it can't
    predict the content of portions of the message that are not within quotes.
  </p>
  <p>There are a number of escape sequences that can be embedded within the
  Message string that the preview will properly display:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Escape sequence</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>\r\n</td>
        <td>Inserts a line break into the message.  You should use these to
        ensure that your message is not too wide because there is no automatic
        word wrap available in the message functions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>\t</td>
        <td>This represents a tab character, which has no meaning to ShowMessage,
        but could be used as a shortcut for character number 9.  If you have a
        frequently used graphic that you want to insert in your messages, you
        could make it number 9 and use this shorthand instead of the full
        escape sequence for the extended character as described below</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>\u00xx</td>
        <td>You can use this sequence to insert extended characters or graphics
        into your message.  The "xx" portion of the code represents a 2-character
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> code.
        For example \u001f would insert character number 31 into the message
        (this is the last character right before the normal printable characters
        in the CoolFont and FireFont tilesets).  You can use this code to insert
        any tile number from 0 through 255 from the current font tileset into the
        message.  Use the "..." button to select the tile from a list and have
        this code generated for you.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>One other feature of the message editor you will see in the preview area is
  the presence of width guides.  There are two vertical lines labeled "320"
  indicating the width of a 320-pixel-wide view.  If the message fits within
  these guides, it will fit similarly on a single-view display with a width of
  320 pixels, or within a horizontally split display of 640 pixels where each
  view is 320 pixels.  Similarly, there are guides for 400, 640 and 800 pixel
  widths.  They will only be visible of the form is large enough to fit them in
  the viewing area.</p>
