<h2>Notice</h2>
<p> This program is incomplete.  Included in this archive is preliminary
    source code for version 2.0 of the Scrolling Game Development Kit, which
    is being distributed only for information and experimentation.  It is
    not intended to be used as finished, released software.

<h2>Information</h2>
<p>     The source code included in this archive uses Microsoft's .NET
    platform.  The .NET framework has a built-in C# compiler.  You do not
    need to download any SDK or development platform.  Simply run
    makesgdk2.bat to compile SGDK2IDE.exe.  You DO need to have the
    Microsoft .NET framework installed in order to compile and in order to
    run SGDK2IDE.exe.  The framework can be downloaded from
    <a href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3" details.aspx? FamilyID='262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3""' downloads www.microsoft.com http:>
    Microsoft's download page</a>
<p>
    You will also need DirectX 9.0, and you might need to modify
    makesgdk2.bat, depending on the version of DirectX and the version of
    the .NET framework you are using.  The output executable is named
    SGDK2IDE.exe.  This file is included in the archive for your
    convenience in case you are unable to configure a build environment.
<p>
    Also included in this archive is a test project that shows off a
    few of the feratures implemented so far.  TestPrj.sg2 can be loaded
    into the program and viewed to see how SGDK2 will handle overlapping
    and composite tiles.
