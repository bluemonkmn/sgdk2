  <h1>What's New</h1>
  <p>This page documents updates between various updates to SGDK 2.0.
  If you're interested in the differences between the 1.x versions and
  version 2.0, see the <a href="Introduction.html#WhatsNew">
  What's New section of the Introduction</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Version 2.1.2</h2>
  <p>This section describes updates between versions 2.1 and 2.1.2.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Upgrade to OpenTK 0.9.8.</li>
    <li>Check if graphic sheet (texture) is larger than supported by the OpenGL
    driver in order to provide a better error message if it's too big.</li>
    <li>Add TileCategoryTouched function to provide simpler ability to check
    when a sprite touches a tile in a category.</li>
    <li>Use frame's color modulation when drawing the frame with
    DrawCounterAsTile.</li>
    <li>Correct handling of TouchTiles for non-square sprites.</li>
    <li>Correct TileAddSprite to register old position as initial position.</li>
    <li>Create TileChangeTouched function to change one tile at a time.</li>
    <li>Deliver standard functions for pushing and repelling sprites.</li>
    <li>Improve error handling when converting rules to source code.</li>
    <li>Remove dllmap from configuration file because Microsoft .NET
    cannot handle it.  Plan to use a hard link or symbolic link to new filename
    libfmodex.so instead (linked to versioned libfmodex-v.so).</li>
    <li>Improve some sprite rule function implementations.</li>
    <li>Implement limited support for generating Linux projects.</li>
    <li>Prevent errors when null rule parameters are encountered while
    compiling.</li>
    <li>Improve drawing of gradient rings (2-D torus) in graphics editor.</li>
    <li>Upgrade FMOD to stable version 4.20.06.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Version 2.1</h2>
  <p>This section describes updates between versions 2.0 and 2.1.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Upgrade to .NET 2.0: SGDK2 and the projects it generates now rely
    on .NET Framework version 2.0 and take advantage of new features added
    in this version. The SGDK2 Project itself requires Visual C# 2008 or .NET
    3.0 to compile, but can run on any system that has .NET Framework 2.0.
    It also knows how to compile game projects on any system with .NET 2.0.</li>
    <li>OpenGL Framework: Version 2.0 was based on Managed DirectX. SGDK 2.1 uses
    the OpenTK library to access the OpenGL interface to video hardware, 
    allowing SGDK2 to and the projects created with it to potentially
    be more easily ported to other platforms.  This also provided an
    apparent performance boost.</li>
    <li>Improved Message Functions: Displaying messages is now an integrated
    function in SGDK2 instead of a custom object.  Furthermore, it now uses
    a tileset as the font instead of using the fonst support provided by the
    system (because as of this writing, OpenTK does not properly support
    fonts).  This means, however, that you can use graphics and animated
    tiles/characters in your messages.  A new message preview window is
    provided to assist in laying out the message at design time.</li>
    <li>Frame Rate Limit: If your game runs too fast on some systems,
    you can now use the <a href="html/M_GeneralRules_LimitFrameRate.htm">LimitFrameRate</a>
    function to control the speed.</li>
    <li>Cut Rules: It's now possible to cut a group of rules when using
    a rule editor. This can also be used to delete hierarchies of rules.</li>
    <li>Upgrade Documentation: This help file is now being built with <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=E82EA71D-DA89-42EE-A715-696E3A4873B2&displaylang=en">Sandcastle</a>
    and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a>
    instead of NDOC because NDOC did not support .NET 2.0.  As a result the
    build process is somewhat simplified and the content is better linked with
    some other improvements wrapped in too.</li>    
    <li>Convert Rules: In the sprite rule editor and plan rule editor, you may
    now select the &quot;Convert to Function&quot; command to convert rules into
    source code that can be directly maintained in the code editor.  If you have
    huge trees of complex rules, this may help you significantly simplify your
    sprite definitions, and make them more managable.
    <li>Call Sprite Functions from Plan Rules: Now you can select &quot;&lt;Select
    sprite function...&gt;&quot; from the function list in the plan rule editor if
    you want to directly call a function on a sprite from a plan.  This can be
    particularly handy if you've converted a set of rules on a sprite into
    a function that you want a plan to be able to easily trigger directly.
  </ol>

  <p>
    If this list seems short, notice that the first two items are relatively
    large, and also that the goal was to get the major update out to folks and
    in use before proceeding with a multitude of smaller updates.  That way
    everyone doesn't have to wait for all the small updates to be complete before
    being able to use the updated framework.
